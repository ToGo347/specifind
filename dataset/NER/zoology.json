This study presents a chromosome-level G. japonicus genome, revealing that its evolutionary breakpoint regions were enriched with specific repetitive elements and defense response genes. Gene families unique to G. japonicus and positively selected genes are mainly enriched in immune, sensory, and nervous pathways. Expansion of bitter taste receptor type 2 primarily in insectivorous species could be associated with toxin clearance. Detox cytochrome P450 in G. japonicus has undergone more birth and death processes than biosynthesis-type P450 genes. Proline, cysteine, glycine, and serine in corneous beta proteins of G. japonicus might influence flexibility and setae adhesiveness. Certain thermosensitive transient receptor potential channels under relaxed purifying selection or positive selection in G. japonicus might enhance adaptation to climate change. This genome assembly offers insights into the adaptive evolution of gekkotans. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)"

            "text": "In bioarchaeology, the biometry of archaeozoological remains is an important component of studies on domestic species and size has been used for multiple purposes from identifying domestication, to track environmental changes or evolution of husbandry practices. The establishment of the Roman Empire has been accompanied by social, political and economic transformations that also reflect in farming practices and animal husbandry. In southern France, biometric variation has already been partially perceived during Roman times, particularly for cattle, but lack chronological accuracy and statistical validation. This paper presents a diachronic analysis of linear measurements of post-cranial bones belonging to the domestic triad (sheep, goat, cattle and suids) in western Gallia Narbonensis (France), between the Roman conquest and Late Antiquity, i.e. from 200 BCE to 400 AD. Biometric data from 64 archaeological sites, excavated and studied over more than 30 years of preventive archaeology, were analysed using a Log Size Index (LSI) approach using time as a continuous variable. The analysis of 5533 measurements first analysed per bone and variable, then separating length, breadth and depth dimensions, revealed different trends, highly influenced by the number of measurements, reflecting allometric differences but also cases of asynchronous evolution. However, these allometries within species are small when compared to interspecies differences. Overall, the size of the four taxa increased from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD. Cattle and pig sizes then decreased from the 2nd century AD and only from the 4th century onwards for goats, while sheep size tends to increase during the 3rd-4th centuries. If the Roman conquest influences the size of the domestic animals, this does not affect the four species in the same way. This potentially reflects differentiated agropastoral strategies for each of the species in the western part of Gallia Narbonensis during the Roman period. This study, which provides a diachronic and cross-species study framework, should be seen as a first step for a more in-depth understanding of micro-regional and socio-economic variation in domestic species morphologies. \u00a9 2022"

In the past decade, however, more generalized forms of spatiotemporally nonseparable solution started to emerge with growing importance for their striking physical effects. This roadmap intends to highlight the recent advances in the creation and control of increasingly complex spatiotemporally sculptured pulses, from spatiotemporally separable to complex nonseparable states, with diverse geometric and topological structures, presenting a bird\u2019s eye viewpoint on the zoology of spatiotemporal light fields and the outlook of future trends and open challenges. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Alases have a limited capacity in their active layer, and specific conditions for soil, flora and fauna formation. A comprehensive study of alas landscape functionswas carried out in Central Yakutia from 1988 to the present time using conventional methods of geobotany, zoology, entomology, etc. This paper presents long-term observations of lake fluctuation cycles and changes in the spatial structure of meadow spaces. The dynamics of the spatial structure lead to significant fluctuations in the productivity of alas phytocenoses. It was revealed that wet and normal alas meadows have the highest vegetation productivity. The long-term course of their productivity tends to decrease, which shows the influence of anthropogenic pressure since the main haymaking areas are located in these meadows. With sharp fluctuations in interannual weather conditions, which determine the microclimatic and soil characteristics of grass growth, the productivity of the edge phytocenoses tends to increase. The productivity of the steppe phytocenoses of the alas remains practically at the same level. Over the years of observation, the economic capacity of alas pastures and hayfields was calculated. Additionally, the paper presents the important role of fauna within closed alas ecosystems, which directly affects the functioning of alas landscapes and is directly involved in soil formation and the circulation of matter and energy. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

The study is based on little known and partly unexplored archival documents, conducted a historical reconstruction of Ukrainian-Hungarian scientific academic cooperation in 1953\u20131970. The research methodology consists in the application of historical-archival, source studies, chronological methods, as well as methods of analytical and synthetic processing of materials and scientific expertise. The scientific novelty of the work lies in the systematization and analysis of an extensive set of archival sources on the history of Ukrainian-Hungarian interacademic relations, introduction of unexplored archival documents and, based on them, comprehensive reconstruction of areas and forms of cooperation between academic institutions and individual scientists of Ukraine and Hungary. This study also popularize the Archival fond of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Conclusions. Based on the analysis of archival documents and the involvement of individual developments of Ukrainian scientists in the research problem, we conclude that scientific cooperation between Ukrainian and Hungarian scientists during 1953\u20131970 developed dynamically and aimed at solving important scientific issues. Cooperation in the field of practical implementation of research results was especially fruitful. If in the 50's of the 20th century and in the early 60's of the 20th century cooperation had a partly acquaintanci nature with the work of both Ukrainian and Hungarian scientists, then from the mid-60's of the 20th century bilateral cooperation was actualized by the implementation of joint research and development in many scientific areas. The most effective was cooperation in biochemistry, chemistry, physiology, geology, geophysics, zoology, mathematics, cybernetics, and socio-humanitarian sciences. \u00a9 2023, Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine.

To provide better understanding of long tail feathers, we sequenced Korean long-tailed chicken (KLC) genomes and compared them with genomes of other chicken breeds. We first analyzed the genome structure of KLC and its genomic relationship with other chickens and observed unique characteristics. Subsequently, we searched for genomic regions under selection. Feather keratin 1-like enriched region and several genes were found to have novel putative functions and effects on the long tail trait in KLC. Our findings support the value of KLC as a unique genetic resource and cast light on the genetic basis of long tail traits in avian species. We expect this novel knowledge to provide new genomic evidence and options for designing and implementing genetic improvements of ornamental chicken productivity through precision crossbreeding aids. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)"

P. mucosa is widely bred for its uses in traditional medicine, scientific research, and handicrafts. Therefore, genome resources of P. mucosa could play an important role in the efficacy of traditional medicine and the analysis of the living environment of this species. Here, we present a highly continuous P. mucosa genome with a size of 1.74 Gb. Its scaffold N50 length is 9.57 Mb, and the maximal scaffold length is 78.3 Mb. Its CG content is 37.9%, and its gene integrity reaches 86.6%. Assembled using long-reads, the total length of the repeat sequences in the genome reaches 735 Mb, and its repeat content is 42.19%. Finally, 24,869 functional genes were annotated in this genome. This study may assist in understanding P. mucosa and supporting medicinal research. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)."

These texts present the museum as a place in which we confront extinction through conflicting emotions: a space of care and protection, built on acts of violence. My analysis explores how physical prehension, real or imagined, contributes to mental prehension, and thus helps us to grasp the sixth mass extinction. I examine how metonymical relations connect museums to damaged environments, including zones, like the ocean, that are perceived as sacrifice zones in the making. I contrast Clarke\u2019s sequence of poems \u2018Behind Glass\u2019, where ekphrasis connects the beauty of endangered specimens with protected landscapes, to Robinson\u2019s \u2018Memories of Flight at the Life Museum\u2019 and Jamie\u2019s \u2018Voyager, Chief\u2019 and \u2018The Hvalsalen\u2019, which emphasise the collection\u2019s dependence on the depletion of lands and oceans. This leads me to outline two textual approaches to the natural history museum: the first reads the specimen as a synecdoche for endangered, yet protected environments, while the second connects the collection, metonymically and metaphorically, to anthropogenic extinction and sacrifice zones. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

A mid-intertidal limpet Cellana toreuma was collected at various time points across both daytime and nighttime in winter during low tide for investigating the diurnal metabolomic responses to cold stress and elucidating the divergent metabolic responses to temperature variations across microhabitats. Temperatures of emergent rock microhabitats were lower than the tidal pool and even aggravated at night. A series of metabolomic responses exhibited coordinated diurnal changes in winter. Metabolic responses which were associated with cellular stress responses and energy metabolism of emergent rock microhabitat individuals were highly induced compared to the tidal pool ones. This study shed light on the diurnal patterns of metabolomic responses of intertidal molluscs in the field and emphasized the variations in metabolic responses between microhabitats. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)"

There are roughly 140 species of New World marsupials, of which the opossum is the best known. Thanks to recent research, there is now an increasing amount of understanding about their evolution, biogeography, systematics, ecology, and conservation in the Americas, especially in South America. There are also some 270 marsupial species in the Australasian region, many of which have been subject to research only in recent years. Based on this information and the authors\u2019 extensive research, this book provides comprehensive insights into the world's marsupials. It will appeal to academics and specialized researchers, students of zoology, paleontology, evolutionary biology, ecology, physiology and conservation as well as interested non-experts. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

In China, key players in these developments have been the recently launched National Stem Cell Resource Center (NSCRC) and its partner organizations in Guangzhou and Shanghai who together, have more than 600 hPSC lines formally recorded in the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology's stem cell registry. In addition, 47 of these hPSCs have also been registered with the hPSCreg project which means they are independently certified for use in European Commission funded research projects. The NSCRC are currently using their own cell lines to manufacture eight different cell types qualified for clinical use, that are being used in nine clinical studies for different indications. The Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOZ-CAS) has worked with NSCRC to establish Chinese and international standards in stem cell research. IOZ-CAS was also a founding partner in the International Stem Cell Banking Initiative which brings together key stem cell banks to agree minimum standards for the provision of pluripotent stem cells for research and clinical use. Here, we describe recent developments in China in the establishment of hPSCs for use in the manufacture of cell therapies and the significant national and international coordination which has now been established to promote the translation of Chinese hPSC-based products into clinical use according to national and international standards. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Here, we report a chromosome-scale genome of the raccoon dog with high contiguity, completeness, and accuracy. The intact taste receptor genes, expanded gene families, and positively selected genes related to digestion, absorption, foraging, and detoxification likely support the omnivory of raccoon dogs. Several positively selected genes and raccoon dog-specific mutations in TDRD6 and ZP3 genes may explain their high reproductivity. Enriched GO terms in energy metabolism and positively selected immune genes were speculated to be closely related to the diverse immune system of raccoon dogs. In addition, we found that several expanded gene families and positively selected genes related to lipid metabolism and insulin resistance may contribute to winter sleep of the raccoon dog. This high-quality genome provides a valuable resource for understanding the evolutionary characteristics of this species. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

Leopards (Panthera pardus) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta Crocuta) are higher order predators that are data deficient across much of their East African range and in Uganda, excepting for one peer-reviewed study on hyenas, there are presently no credible population estimates for these species. A lack of information on the population status and even baseline densities of these species has ramifications as leopards are drawcards for the photo-tourism industry, and along with hyenas are often responsible for livestock depredations from pastoralist communities. Leopards are also sometimes hunted for sport. Establishing baseline density estimates for these species is urgently needed not only for population monitoring purposes, but in the design of sustainable management offtakes, and in assessing certain conservation interventions like financial compensation for livestock depredation. Accordingly, we ran a single-season survey of these carnivores in the Lake Mburo National Park of south-western Uganda using 60 remote camera traps distributed in a paired format at 30 locations. We analysed hyena and leopard detections under a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) modelling framework to estimate their densities. This small national park (370 km2) is surrounded by Bahima pastoralist communities with high densities of cattle on the park edge (with regular park incursions). Leopard densities were estimated at 6.31 individuals/100 km2 (posterior SD = 1.47, 95% CI [3.75-9.20]), and spotted hyena densities were 10.99 individuals/100 km2, but with wide confidence intervals (posterior SD = 3.35, 95% CI [5.63-17.37]). Leopard and spotted hyena abundance within the boundaries of the national park were 24.87 (posterior SD 7.78) and 39.07 individuals (posterior = SD 13.51) respectively. Leopard densities were on the middle end of SECR studies published in the peer-reviewed literature over the last 5 years while spotted hyena densities were some of the first reported in the literature using SECR, and similar to a study in Botswana which reported 11.80 spotted hyenas/100 km2. Densities were not noticeably lower at the park edge, and in the southwest of our study site, despite repeated cattle incursions into these areas. We postulate that the relatively high densities of both species in the region could be owed to impala Aepyceros melampus densities ranging from 16.6-25.6 impala/km2. Another, potential explanatory variable (albeit a speculative one) is the absence of interspecific competition from African lions (Panthera leo), which became functionally extinct (there is only one male lion present) in the park nearly two decades ago. This study provides the first robust population estimate of these species anywhere in Uganda and suggests leopards and spotted hyenas continue to persist in the highly modified landscape of Lake Mburo National Park. \u00a9 2022.

Health authorities are recognising the potential importance of citizen science to expanding or enhancing traditional surveillance programs. Different programs have shown success in engaging communities to monitor species of medical importance through low-cost methods. The Mozzie Monitors project was established on iNaturalist\u2014an open citizen science platform that allows participants to upload photos (i.e., observers) and assist identification (i.e., identifiers). This article describes the likelihood of citizen scientists submitting photos of mosquitoes, assesses user submission behaviour, and evaluates public health utility from these citizen science-derived data. From October 2018 to July 2021, the Mozzie Monitors project on iNaturalist received 2118 observations of 57 different species of mosquitoes across Australia. The number of observers in the system increased over time with more than 500 observers and 180 identifiers being active in the project since its establishment. Data showed species bias with large-bodied and colourful mosquitoes being over-represented. Analyses also indicate regional differentiation of mosquito fauna per state, seasonality of activity, and ecological information about mosquitoes. The iNaturalist citizen science platform also allows connectedness, facilitated communication and collaboration between overall users and expert entomologists, of value to medical entomology and mosquito management. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

While first postulated in the 1800s, for decades, it was considered a biological myth. A series of elegant behavioral experiments in the 1960s and 1970s showed conclusively that the sense is real; however, the underlying mechanism(s) remained unresolved. Consequently, this has given rise to a series of beliefs that are critically analyzed in this manuscript. We address six assertions: (1) Magnetoreception does not exist; (2) It has to be magnetite; (3) Birds have a conserved six loci magnetic sense system in their upper beak; (4) It has to be cryptochrome; (5) MagR is a protein biocompass; and (6) The electromagnetic induction hypothesis is dead. In advancing counter-arguments for these beliefs, we hope to stimulate debate, new ideas, and the design of well-controlled experiments that can aid our understanding of this fascinating biological phenomenon. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

(2) We monitored the growth and activity of bone growth plates, hormonal profiles, and reproductive activity in males and females of the male-larger gecko Paroedura picta. We show that growth plates fuse in this species in a sex-specific manner. The more abrupt epiphyseal closure and more pronounced growth deceleration in females coincide with the increased activity of their reproductive organs. (3) We conclude that at least some lizards are determinate growers whose sexual size dimorphism is potentially driven by ovarian hormones. The major difference in growth between endothermic and ectothermic amniotes appears to be in the magnitude of growth before and after the first reproduction, not in the mechanistic processes such as senescence of growth plate cells \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)"

In her recent works, living and non-living bodies evolve and morph into one another through moments of emergence and disappearance, such as embryogenesis, metamorphosis, fossilization, as well as the formation and dissolution of rock and ice.

Because she was the national poet of Wales from 2008 to 2016, she is often categorized as a local poet.

Using harness-mounted tri-axial accelerometers free-roaming domestic cats (Felis Catus) we developed a methodology that can precisely classify finer-scale behaviours. We further tested the effect of a prey\u2013protector device designed to reduce prey capture. We aligned accelerometer traces collected at 50\u00a0Hz with video files (60 fps) and labelled 12 individual behaviours, then trained a supervised machine-learning algorithm using Kohonen super self-organising maps (SOM). The SOM was able to predict individual behaviours with a ~ 99.6% overall accuracy, which was slightly better than for random forest estimates using the same dataset (98.9%). There was a significant effect of sample size, with precision and sensitivity decreasing rapidly below 2000 1-s observations. We were also able to detect a behaviour specific reduction in the predictability when cats were fitted with the prey\u2013protector device indicating it altered biomechanical gait. Our results can be applied in movement ecology, zoology and conservation, where habitat specific movement performance between predators or prey may be critical to managing species of conservation significance, or in veterinary and agricultural fields, where early detection of movement pathologies can improve animal welfare. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

Therefore, surveys could be allies for successful proposals of teacher training. We investigated 17 undergraduate students of a Biology course, developed by S\u00e3o Paulo University, during classes of an optative discipline focused on Zoology learning. As objectives, we intended to identify: i) evidence of technological knowledge of the undergraduates; ii) if (and how) that discipline allowed the development of these kinds of knowledge. First, the undergraduate students answered a questionnaire focused on different types of technological knowledge (T-CoRe), as their dialogues were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to Bardin (2013). Then, we interviewed some of these students. We found an adequate understanding in these students about the pedagogical use of technologies. However, we also found gaps in some types of knowledge that are considered necessary for Scientific Literacy. These results are consistent with the training stage of the undergraduates that participated in this survey, but it is essential to include different types of knowledge (including technological) throughout the teacher's training. \u00a9 2021 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Fisica.

Although recent studies have identified various components of AoL gel, it has remained unclear how the molecules are structurally arranged and how their structure influences the function of the organs. Here we describe the structure of AoL gel by microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering and infer that the material is colloidal in nature. To assess the relative function of the gel's protein constituents, we compared the microscopic structure, X-ray scattering, and proton conductivity properties of the gel before and after enzymatic digestion with a protease. We discovered that while proteins were largely responsible for conferring the viscous nature of the gel, their removal did not diminish proton conductivity. The findings lay the groundwork for more detailed studies into the specific interactions of molecules inside AoL gel at the nanoscale. \u00a9 2021 The Authors"

Therefore, the occurrence of the unusual homogametic WW females in nature is plausible. We developed W/Z genomic sex markers and used them to investigate the genotypic structure of experimental and native C. quadricarinatus populations in Australia. We discovered, for the first time, the natural occurrence of WW females in crustacean populations. By modeling population dynamics, we found that intersexuals contribute to the growth rate of crayfish populations in the short term. Given the vastly fragmented C. quadricarinatus habitat, which is characterized by drought-flood cycles, we speculate that intersexuals contribute to the fitness of this species since they lead to occasional increment in the population growth rate which potentially supports crayfish population restoration and establishment under extinction threats or colonization events. \u00a9 2020 The Authors; zoology; genetics; genotyping; evolutionary biology \u00a9 2020 The Authors"

The levels of anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), Estradiol (E2), Progesterone(PRG), Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and Testesterone (T) of treated snails were decreased with increasing the drug concentrations by percentages of -83.3%, -78.9%, - 59.6%,- 98.3 %, - 79.6 %, - 86.7% and 8.2%, respectively. Prolactin (PRL) level was significantly increased (86.9%) compared to control snails after 8 weeks of exposure. Histological investigations on the hermaphrodite glands of snails treated with 909 \u03bcg/gm. showed glandular hyperplasia, sloughing of germinal epithelium, acini sizes reduction, suppression of follicular growths, decreased luteinization and vasodilation. Male acini revealed histolytic of spermatogonia and mature sperms. The lowest concentration (303 \u03bcg/gm.) caused gradual decrease of the total egg counts that reach 50% at the 8th week of treatment. Higher doses (606 and 909 \u03bcg/gm.) resulted in dramatic dwindling of egg numbers and inspiring complete egg cessation at the 7th and 3rd weeks of treatments, respectively. The applications of combined contraceptive drugs as baits give promising results for controlling high population densities of E. vermiculata snails at Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s); Contraceptive drug; oviposition; Hormones; Histopathology; Eobania vermiculata; Food Science; Animal Science; Agronomy; Pesticide; Zoology. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)"

Neonicotinoids are agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are found throughout the insect central nervous system and are the main mediators of synaptic neurotransmission. These receptors are important for the function of the insect central clock and circadian rhythms. The clock allows pollinators to coincide their activity with the availability of floral resources and favorable flight temperatures, as well as impact learning, navigation, and communication. Here we show that exposure to the field-relevant concentration of 10 \u03bcg/L imidacloprid caused a reduction in bumblebee foraging activity, locomotion, and foraging rhythmicity. Foragers showed an increase in daytime sleep and an increase in the proportion of activity occurring at night. This could reduce foraging and pollination opportunities, reducing the ability of the colony to grow and reproduce, endangering bee populations and crop yields. \u00a9 2020; Ecology; Biological Sciences; Zoology; Animal Physiology; Behavioral Neuroscience \u00a9 2020"

            "text": "Background In Zanzibar, little is known about the arboviral disease vector Aedes aegypti in terms of abundance, spatio-temporal distribution of its larval habitats or factors associated with its proliferation. Effective control of the vector requires knowledge on ecology and habitat characteristics and is currently the only available option for reducing the risk of arboviral epidemics in the island nation of Zanzibar. Methodology We conducted entomological surveys in households and surrounding compounds from February to May 2018 in the urban (Mwembemakumbi and Chumbuni) and rural (Chuini and Kama) Shehias (lowest government administrative unit) situated in the Urban-West region of Unguja island, Zanzibar. Larvae and pupae were collected, transported to the insectary, reared to adult, and identified to species level. Characteristics and types of water containers were also recorded on site. Generalized linear mixed models with binomial and negative binomial distributions were applied to determine factors associated with presence of Ae. aegypti immatures (i.e. both larvae and pupae) or pupae, alone and significant predictors of the abundance of immature Ae. aegypti or pupae, respectively. Results The survey provided evidence of widespread presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in both urban and rural settings of Unguja Island. Interestingly, rural setting had higher numbers of infested containers, all immatures, and pupae than urban setting. Like-wise, higher House and Breteau indices were recorded in rural compared to the urban set-ting. There was no statistically significant difference in Stegomyia indices between seasons across settings. Plastics, metal containers and car tires were identified as the most productive habitats which collectively produced over 90% of all Ae. aegypti pupae. Water storage, sun exposure, vegetation, and organic matter were significant predictors of the abundance of immature Ae. aegypti. Conclusions Widespread presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti were found in rural and urban areas of Unguja, the main island of Zanzibar. Information on productive habitats and predictors of colonization of water containers are important for the development of a routine Aedes surveillance system and targeted control interventions in Zanzibar and similar settings. \u00a9 2020 Saleh et al."

The Kola Meridian transect, along 33\u00b030\u2019E, in the Barents Sea is the longest term monitoring area in the Arctic. Regular (usually annual) hydrobiological benthic surveys along that transect have been performed since 1899. Materials stored in museum collections remain the main source of the faunistic information obtained during the surveys, while only a minor part of these data was published. We reexamined all samples of shell-bearing gastropods from the Kola Meridian stored at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and at Saint Petersburg State University. We found only 159 museum lots from 73 samples, which constitute a very small portion of the total material collected along the transect. Approximately one-third of them (54 lots) was misidentified or includes individuals that cannot be identified at species level. The species composition revealed by museum materials differs substantially from published checklists. Majority of the studied samples (40) were collected during 1899\u20131920. However, the extant collections do not provide a reliable baseline for the Kola Meridian. We propose that the storage of zoological material in public collections should be considered as an essential part of long-term monitoring programmes. \u00a9 2021 I.O. Nekhaev & A.V. Merkuliev."

            "text": "Several Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches are available for managing pests of varied kinds, including individual and integrated methods for pest suppression. Recently the focus has shifted to pest management tools that act on insect systems selectively, are compatible with the environment, and are not harmful for ecosystems. Other approaches target specific biochemical and physiological aspects of insect metabolism, and involve biotechnological and genetic manipulation. Still other approaches include the use of nanotechnology, endophytes, optical and sonic manipulation to detect and control pest insects. Unfortunately, conventional forms of pest management do not focus on technology transfer to the ground level workers and farmers. As a result, farmers are incurring huge losses of crops and revenues. This book highlights the importance of using communication tools in pest management and demonstrates some success stories of utilizing automated unmanned technologies in this context. The content is divided into three sections, the first of which, \"Pest Population Monitoring: Modern Tools,\" covers long and short-range pest population monitoring techniques and tools such as satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles/drones, remote sensing, digital tools like GIS, GPS for mapping, lidar, mobile apps, software systems, artificial diet designs and functional diversity of info-chemicals. The second section of the book is devoted to \"Emerging Areas in Pest Management\" and offers a glimpse of diversified tactics that have been developed to contain and suppress pest populations such as endophytes, insect vectors of phytoplasma, Hymenopterans parasitoids, mass production and utilization of NPV etc. In turn, the third section focuses on \"Integrated Pest Management\" and presents farming situations that illustrate how research in diversified aspects has helped to find solutions to specific pest problems, and how some new and evolving tactics can be practically implemented. Given its scope, the book offers a valuable asset for entomology and plant pathology researchers, students of zoology and plant protection, and readers whose work involves agriculture, horticulture, forestry and other ecosystems. \u00a9 Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

This mixed-methods approach quantifies and characterizes acknowledgments to libraries in the journal literature. Using WoS's Funding Text field, the acknowledgments for six peer universities were identified and then characterized. The efficacy of using WoS to locate library acknowledgments was assessed by comparing the WoS Funding Text search results to the actual acknowledgment text found in the articles. Acknowledgments to libraries were found in articles at all six peer universities, though the absolute and relative numbers were quite low (< 0.5%). Most of the library acknowledgments were for resources (collections, funding, etc.), and many were concentrated in natural history (e.g. zoology). Examination of Texas A&M University zoology articles found that 91.7% of the funding information came from \"acknowledgments\"and not specifically a funding acknowledgment section. The WoS Funding Text search found 56% of the library acknowledgments compared to a search of the actual acknowledgment text in the articles. Limiting publications to journals, using a single truncated search term, and including only six research universities in the United States. This study examined library acknowledgments, but the same approach could be applied to searches of other keywords, institutions/organizations, individuals, etc. While not specifically designed to search general acknowledgments, WoS's Funding Text field can be used as an exploratory tool to search acknowledgments beyond funding. There are a few studies that have examined library acknowledgments in the scholarly literature, though to date none of those studies have examined the efficacy of using the WoS Funding Text field to locate those library acknowledgments within the journal literature.  \u00a9 2020 2020 David E.

Harnessing taxonomic data for rapid, automated species identification by machine learning tools or DNA metabarcoding techniques has great potential but will require their review, accessible storage, comprehensive comparison, and integration with prior knowledge and information. Currently, data production, management, and sharing in taxonomic studies are not keeping pace with these needs. Indeed, a survey of recent taxonomic publications provides evidence that few species descriptions in zoology and botany incorporate DNA sequence data. The use of modern high-throughput (-omics) data is so far the exception in alpha-taxonomy, although they are easily stored in GenBank and similar databases. By contrast, for the more routinely used image data, the problem is that they are rarely made available in openly accessible repositories. Improved sharing and re-using of both types of data requires institutions that maintain long-term data storage and capacity with workable, user-friendly but highly automated pipelines. Top priority should be given to standardization and pipeline development for the easy submission and storage of machine-readable data (e.g., images, audio files, videos, tables of measurements). The taxonomic community in Germany and the German Federation for Biological Data are researching options for a higher level of automation, improved linking among data submission and storage platforms, and for making existing taxonomic information more readily accessible. \u00a9 2020, The Author(s)."

            "text": "The past several decades have ushered in a golden age in the study of migration biology, leading to a wealth of descriptive articles that characterize various aspects of migration and its implications for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. However, relatively few studies have adopted an experimental approach to the study of migration, and fewer still have combined lab and field experiments to glean insights into the mechanisms underlying variation in migration behavior and success. Understanding the proximate and ultimate causes of migration timing, energy allocation and optimization, migration success, and fitness is important to aid the conservation and management of wildlife populations by establishing appropriate protections or managing environmental conditions that influence migration. With recent technological advances and miniaturization of animal-borne electronic tracking devices, as well as ground-, water-, and space-based telemetry infrastructure, researchers have the tools necessary to experimentally test hypotheses central to the mechanics of migrations and individual variation therein. By pairing physiological measurements, molecular analyses, and other approaches within an experimental framework, there is the potential to understand not only how animal migrations function but also what differentiates successful migrations from failed migrations and the associated fitness implications. Experimental approaches to migration biology are particularly important, as they will help us to better comprehend and hopefully predict animal responses to environmental and anthropogenic changes by isolating confounding variables that challenge inferences from observations."

Here we analyze the Finnish matriculation examination in biology from the 1920s to 1960s to understand how the exam has evolved in both its knowledge content and educational form. Each question was classified according to its topic in biology, and its cognitive level by Bloom's taxonomy. Overall, the exam progressed from a rather dichotomous test of botany and zoology to a modern exam covering biology from biochemistry to environmental science, reflecting the development of biology as a scientific discipline. The contribution of genetics increased steadily, while ecology witnessed a decline and a renaissance during the same time period. The biological profile of the questions was established by the 1950s. The educational standard and cognitive demand of the questions was always high and established by the 1940s. \u00a9 2020 University of Helsinki. All rights reserved."

The emphasis is on her forays into many areas of insect endocrinology, supported by her graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The main theme is the hormonal regulation of metamorphosis, especially the roles of juvenile hormone (JH). The article describes the work of her laboratory first in the elucidation of the endocrinology of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and later in the molecular aspects of the regulation of cuticular and pigment proteins and of the ecdysone-induced transcription factor cascade during molting and metamorphosis.

Standing variation among ancestral populations often drives phenotypic change during domestication, but some changes are caused by novel mutations. In dogs (Canis familiaris) specifically, it has been suggested that the ability to interpret social-communicative behavior expressed by humans originated post-domestication and this behavior is thus not expected to occur in wolves (Canis lupus). Here we report the observation of three 8-week-old wolf puppies spontaneously responding to social-communicative behaviors from an unfamiliar person by retrieving a ball. This behavioral expression in wolves has significant implications for our understanding and expectations of the genetic foundations of dog behavior. Importantly, our observations indicate that behavioral responses to human social-communicative cues are not unique to dogs. This suggests that, although probably rare, standing variation in the expression of human-directed behavior in ancestral populations could have been an important target for early selective pressures exerted during dog domestication.

Here, we present a report dedicated to ONNV epidemiological distribution. Two large-scale ONNV outbreaks have been identified in Africa in the last 60 years, interspersed with sporadic serosurveys and case reports of returning travelers. The assessment of the real scale of ONNV circulation in Africa remains a difficult task and surveillance studies are necessary to fill this gap. The identification of ONNV etiology is made complicated by the absence of multiplex tools in co-circulation areas and that of reference standards, as well as the high cross-reactivity with related pathogens observed in serological tests, in particular with CHIKV. This is a specific obstacle for seroprevalence studies, that necessitate an improvement of serological tools to provide robust results. The scarcity of existent genetic data currently limits molecular epidemiology studies. ONNV epidemiology would also benefit from reinforced entomological and environmental surveillance. Finally, the natural history of the disease deserves to be further investigated, with a specific attention paid to long-term complications. Considering our incomplete knowledge on ONNV distribution, GloPID-R CHIKV, ONNV and MAYV experts recommend that a major effort should be done to fill existing gaps. \u00a9 2019 The Authors"

A handout is one of the effective learning resources to achieve learning goals. Researchers created a handout to facilitate students to learn about the diversity and activities of Odonata at the wetlands around ULM Banjarmasin. This study aims to describe practicality of the Odonata handout. Research and development of handouts are based on Borg and Gall development model. This research was conducted in ULM Banjarmasin. The research subjects included three expert validation, nine students for small readability tests, and 18 students for small-scale field trials. Data analysis uses descriptive categorical techniques. The practicality of handout is indicated by students' activity and students' responses after they use handouts. The handouts based on students' activity showed very high activity and showed a very strong positive response. \u00a9 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd."

It is therefore important to consider whether ingredients other than the active may: 1) alter absorption of the active chemical, or 2) be absorbed themselves, resulting in systemic effects. Frogs have highly permeable skin and are routinely exposed to commercial chemical products in the environment or therapeutically. Ethanol and propylene glycol (PG), which have known penetration-enhancing effects, are commonly included in such products. The current study has therefore investigated the in vitro absorption kinetics through Rh. marina skin of three model chemicals \u2013 caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen \u2013 formulated individually as solutions containing: 1%, 10% or 30% v/v ethanol, or 20% v/v PG. Differential scanning calorimetry and histology were used to characterise fresh frog skin, investigate the mechanism of these enhancers in frog skin, and to determine whether these enhancers significantly affected skin structure. Results showed that the extent of absorption enhancement was influenced by chemical, enhancer and skin region, and that enhancement was generally not consistent for individual enhancers or skin regions. The exception was 1% v/v ethanol, which did not significantly alter flux across the skin for any of the chemicals evaluated. Caffeine absorption was not enhanced by any of the investigated penetration enhancers, and was in fact significantly reduced by 30% v/v ethanol and PG. Ethanol caused concentration-dependant changes in skin morphology and should be avoided in concentrations \u226510% v/v. PG, however, caused minimal changes to the skin and consistently improved absorption of benzoic acid and ibuprofen through all skin regions. Owing to the significant changes in skin structure following \u226510% v/v ethanol exposure, it is recommended to avoid its use in frogs. For enhancement of penetration of moderately-to-highly lipophilic chemicals, this study has identified 20% v/v PG should to be the enhancer of choice. \u00a9 2019 The Authors"

The honey bee gut microbiota is a highly rewarding community to study, as honey bees are critical pollinators of many crops for human consumption and produce valuable commodities such as honey and wax. Most significantly, unique characteristics of the Apis mellifera gut habitat make it a valuable model system. This review discusses methods and pipelines used in the study of the gut microbiota of Ap.\u00a0mellifera and closely related species for four main purposes: identifying microbiota taxonomy, characterizing microbiota genomes (microbiome), characterizing microbiota\u2013microbiota interactions and identifying functions of the microbial community in the gut. The purpose of this contribution is to increase understanding of honey bee gut microbiota, to facilitate bee microbiota and microbiome research in general and to aid design of future experiments in this growing field. \u00a9 2019 The Royal Entomological Society"

No human vaccines are currently available, and both diagnosis and treatment are sometimes ineffectual, leading to advocacy for self-directed preventative measures. These recommendations are widely communicated to the public, but there is limited evidence for their efficacy. We undertook a systematic review and mixed-effects meta-regression analysis of factors purported to increase or decrease risk of black-legged tick bites and tick-borne disease. Published articles used in the study spanned the years 1984-2018. Variables associated with increased probability of tick-borne disease, with odds ratios significantly greater than 1, included deer abundance, high density of nymph-stage black-legged ticks, landscapes with interspersed herbaceous and forested habitat, low human population density, gardens, cat ownership, and race. Contrary to recommendations, use of landscape-related tick control measures, such as clearing brush, trimming branches, and having a dry barrier between lawn and woods, tended to increase risk. Pet ownership increased bite risk. Bite risk was highest for children aged 5 years or less, with a secondary peak in persons aged 50-70 years. Although some widely disseminated recommendations are supported by the research analyzed, others require further evaluation. Additional research is also needed to understand the mechanisms underlying significant relationships. \u00a9 2019 The Author(s)."

After the late gastrula stage, the archenteron separates from the ectoderm to form an archenteral sac, which develops into a dumbbell shape consisting of anterior and posterior lobes, and a middle part connecting both lobes. The anterior and posterior lobes, and the middle part, become separated into an axo-hydrocoel, the left and right somatocoels and an enteric sac, respectively. The hydrocoel forms from the left lower edge of the axo-hydrocoel and becomes separated from the axocoel by the late dipleurula stage, when chambered organs and coelom X bud off from the anterior tip of the right and left somatocoels, respectively. Coelom X does not occur in comatulid crinoids (feather stars), and its fate is unclear. The pore canal extends from the axocoel. The hydrocoel differentiates into a crescent shape at the overtime semidoliolaria stage, a few days after the semidoliolaria becomes competent to settle. Coelomogenesis in M. rotundus is much simpler than in the comatulids and probably represents the ancestral mode of the crinoids. As each portion of the dumbbell sac differentiates almost in situ into each coelom, presumptive fates in the sac are easily followed in M. rotundus. \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

For larvicidal assay, the acetone extract of both plants showed maximum effects, with the least LC50 and LC90 values (P. tomentosa (5.968 and 7.493 \u03bcg/ml) and T. asiatica (1.288 and 1.992 \u03bcg/ml)) and the same extract of both plants exhibited better pupicidal potency. The adulticidal activity of both plants (0\u201360 min interval periods) recorded best results in acetone extracts and the LC50 and LC90 values were recorded as P. tomentosa (32.105 and 41.001 \u03bcg/ml) and T. asiatica (09.012 and 11.854 \u03bcg/ml). Among the two plants P. tomentosa acetone leaf extract have good antiviral property against Dengue viral cell line. In addition, the phytochemical nature of the plant reveals the presence of saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids in all the tested extracts of both plants. GC-MS analysis revealed Hexanedioic acid, Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) Ester (22.54) and 2,6,10,14,18,22- Tetracosahexane, 2,6,10, 15, 19,15,19,23- Hexamethyl-(ALL-E)- (25.33) identified as two major phytoconstitutents in P. tomentosa and Tetracontane (23.580) is a major compound identified from T. asiatica acetone extracts. The functional groups of chemical compounds (aromatis, alkanes, alkyls and carboxylic acids) from P. tomentosa and T. asiatica were analyzed by FT-IR spectrum. \u00a9 2019"

Methods: A spatial ecological study design was used to analyse monthly surveillance data of notified dengue fever cases from January 2006 to December 2016 in the 154 districts of Sumatra and 56 districts of Kalimantan. A multivariate, zero-inflated Poisson regression model was developed with a conditional autoregressive prior structure with posterior parameters estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. Results: There were 230\u00a0745 cases in Sumatra and 132\u00a0186 cases in Kalimantan during the study period. In Sumatra, the risk of dengue fever decreased by 9% (95% credible interval [CrI] 8.5\u20139.5%) for a 1% increase in forest cover and by 12.2% (95% CrI 11.9\u201312.6%) for a 1% increase in relative humidity. In Kalimantan, dengue fever risk fell by 17.6% (95% CrI 17.1\u201318.1%) for a 1% increase in relative humidity and rose by 7.6% (95% CrI 6.9\u20138.4%) for a 1\u00a0\u00b0C increase in minimum temperature. There was no significant residual spatial clustering in Sumatra after accounting for climate and demographic variables. In Kalimantan, high residual risk areas were primarily centred in North and East of the island. Conclusions: Dengue fever in Sumatra and Kalimantan was highly seasonal and associated with climate factors and deforestation. Incorporation of climate indicators into risk-based surveillance might be warranted for dengue fever in Indonesia. \u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Sher (1939-2008) is known as a Quaternary palaeontologist, specializing in large mammals, but his contributions to the study of fossil invertebrates (mainly insects) were also great. He was a leader of a small informal scientific group and a member of large network of researchers who studied Beringia with a focus on stratigraphy and paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Different methods, including fossil invertebrate study, were used for these purposes. Sher considered insects to be the key group to develop our understudying of the non-analogue extinct steppe-tundra community. He was the initiator and designer of a digital database for Siberian Quaternary insects (QUINSIB). He applied the MCR method for climate reconstruction in Siberia and used insects for detailed stratigraphic correlations. A.V. Sher worked in both parts of Beringia: northern-east Siberia and Chukotka (Western Beringia) and Alaska and the Yukon (Eastern Beringia); he had the rare gift of being able to observe the whole picture.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SOCINDEX, and LILACS, for experimental and observational studies, economic assessments and qualitative experiences carried out in LAC from 2000 to 2016. We assessed incidence and morbimortality of Aedes aegypti-related diseases and entomological indices: Breteau (containers), House, and Pupae per Person. We used GRADE methodology for assessing quality of evidence. Results: Of 1826 records retrieved, 75 were included and 9 cluster randomised clinical trials could be meta-analysed. We did not identify any intervention supported by a high certainty of evidence. In consistency with qualitative evidence, health education and community engagement probably reduces the entomological indices, as do the use of insecticide-treated materials, indoor residual spraying and the management of containers. There is low certainty of evidence supporting the use of ovitraps or larvitraps, and the integrated epidemiological surveillance strategy to improve indices and reduce the incidence of dengue. The reported degree of implementation of these vector control interventions was variable and most did not extend to whole cities and were not sustained beyond 2\u00a0years. Conclusions: We found a general lack of evidence on effectiveness of vector control in the region, despite a few interventions that showed moderate to low certainty of evidence. It is important to engage and educate the community, apart from achieving the implementation of integrated actions between the health and other sectors at national and regional level. \u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

The total soil macro fauna is influenced by the climatice condition and land utilization pattern. Agroforestry is one of type land utilization that is expected to improve the soil fertility. Land utilization changing from monoculture into agroforestry is predicted to influence the soils macro fauna. This study is aims to find out the population of soil macro fauna before and after applying manglid agroforestry. The research was conducted in Cukangkawung, Tasikmalaya District, West Java Province. Sample of macro fauna was taken from non-productive land of tea plantations and one year after the land was planted by manglid + corn + peanut by using agroforestry. Samples were taken in Feb-March 2015 and once more in Feb-March 2016. The observation land area is 1 hectare that is divided into 1 m x 1 m - 16 observation plots that was placed randomly. In each plot, a hole of 30 cm in depth was made and the dug out soil was placed on the plastic container. The collected macro fauna was counted and placed into a bottle that was filled with 70% alcohol. The macro fauna identification was conducted in LIPI zoology laboratory. The research shows that the diversity indexes for Shanon and Margalef on manglid agroforestry are higher than on the ex tea land. Factors that influence the soil macro fauna diversity improvement is pH, low temperature of soil and high soil moisture. Soil macro fauna becomes organic decomposer in agroforestry for about 56,25% and 20% in non-productive land of tea plants. \u00a9 2019 IJFR All rights reserved."

Churches were inspected for immature and adult mosquitoes once every week from November 2015 to October 2016. A total of 10,997 immatures of five species were collected. The most abundant species were Aedes aegypti (6,051) and Culex quinquefasciatus (3,018). The most common source of immature Ae. aegypti were buckets followed by disposable containers. Adult collections yielded 21,226 mosquitoes of nine species. The most common species were Cx. quinquefasciatus (15,215) and Ae. aegypti (3,902). Aedes aegypti were found all year long. Female Ae. aegypti (1,380) were sorted into pools (166) and assayed for flavivirus RNA by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Two pools were positive for DENV (DENV-1 and 2). In conclusion, we demonstrated that some churches in Merida are infested with mosquitoes all year long and they potentially serve as sites for DENV transmission and should therefore be considered for inclusion in mosquito and arboviruses control and surveillance efforts. \u00a9 2019, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo.

            "text": "Background: In a context of increasing resistance of both vectors toward main classes of insecticides used in public health and parasites toward anti-malarial drugs, development of new and complementary molecules or control approaches is fundamental to achieve the objective of controlling or even eliminating malaria. Concerning vector control, the sterile insect technique and other genetic control approaches are among promising complementary tools in an integrated management strategy for malaria control. These approaches rely not only on a good understanding of vector biology (especially during larval stages), but also on the availability of adequate supplies and protocols for efficient mosquito rearing. The aim of this study was to assess the factors impacting the life history of Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes at the larval stage, in the context of genetic and sterile insect approaches to control malaria vectors. Methods: The effect of different larval diets and larval rearing densities on the development of An. coluzzii were evaluated in the laboratory. Emergence rate (ER), pre-imaginal developmental time (DT) and adult wing length (WL) were measured under different food regimes. Four diets were tested among which three were provided by the Insect Pest Control Laboratory (IPCL) of the FAO/IAEA Joint division. Results: Data showed significant differences in the quality of the different diets and suggested a negative density dependence in all three life history parameters measured under tested rearing conditions. ER and WL increased with food availability, but decreased with increasing larval density. Conversely DT was shortened with increasing food availability but increased with larval density. These data demonstrates intraspecific larval competition modulated by food amount and space availability. Of the four diets tested, the one made of a mix of tuna meal, bovine liver powder, brewer's yeast, squid liver powder and vitamin mix (diet 2) yielded the best results as it produced a good balance between ER, DT and WL. Food availability for optimal development (highest survival at shortest time) was in the range of 180-400 \u03bcg/larvae/day for the three diets provided by the IPCL. Conclusion: There is an interaction between diet type, diet concentration and larval density. Best results in terms of optimal larvae development parameters happen when moderately high values of those three variables are observed. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

            "text": "Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick borne viral disease reported from different parts of the world. The distribution of the CCHF cases are linked with the distribution of the principal vector, Hyalomma anatolicum in the ecosystem. Presently, vector control is mainly dependent on repeated application of acaricides, results in partial efficacy and generated acaricide resistant tick strains. Amongst the different components of integrated management programme, immunization of hosts is considered as one of the sustainable component. To restrict CCHF virus spreading, use of anti-Hyalomma vaccines appears as a viable solution. Accordingly, present study was under taken to characterize and evaluate vaccine potential of two conserved molecules, ferritin2 (FER2) and tropomyosin (TPM). Silencing of the genes conferred a cumulative reduction (rejection + unable to engorge) of 61.3% in FER2 and 70.2% in TPM respectively. Furthermore, 44.2% and 72.7% reduction in engorgement weight, 63.6% and 94.9% reduction in egg masses in FER2 and TPM silenced ticks in comparison to LUC-control group was recorded. The recombinant protein, rHaFER2 was characterized as 35 kDa protein with pI of 5.84 and possesses iron binding domains. While rHaTPM is a 51kDa protein with pI of 4.94 having calcium binding domains. Immunization of cross-bred calves by rHaFER2 conferred 51.7% and 51.2% protection against larvae and adults of H.\u00a0anatolicum challenge infestations. While rHaTPM conferred 63.7% and 66.4% protection against larvae and adults infestations, respectively. The results were comparable with the data generated by RNAi and it clearly showed the possibility for the development of anti-hyalomma vaccine to manage CCHF virus and Theileria annulata infection in human and animals. \u00a9 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"

This study assessed the influence of physical characteristics of houses and surrounding environments on mosquito biting risk in rural Tanzanian villages, and examined knowledge and perceptions of residents on relationships between these factors and malaria transmission. The study further assessed whether people worried about these risks and how they coped. Methods: Entomological surveys of indoor mosquito densities were conducted across four villages in Ulanga district, south-eastern Tanzania. The survey involved 48 sentinel houses sampled monthly and other sets of 48 houses randomly recruited each month for one-off sampling over 12 months. Physical characteristics of the houses and surrounding environments were recorded. Questionnaire surveys were administered to 200 household heads to assess their knowledge and concerns regarding the observed housing and environmental features, and whether they considered these features when constructing houses. Focus group discussions, were conducted to clarify emergent themes on people's perceptions on relationships between housing or environmental factors and malaria transmission. Results: The entomological surveys showed statistically higher indoor densities of the malaria vectors (Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus) in houses with mud walls compared to plastered or brick walls, open eaves compared to closed eaves and unscreened windows compared to screened windows. Most respondents reported that their houses allowed mosquito entry, at least partially. Participants were aware that house structure and environmental characteristics influenced indoor mosquito densities and consequently malaria transmission. They were concerned about living in poorly-constructed houses with gaps on eaves, walls, windows and doors but were constrained by low income. Conclusion: In rural south-eastern Tanzania, significant proportions of people still live in houses with open eaves, unscreened windows and gaps on doors. Though they are fully aware of associated mosquito biting and pathogen transmission risks, they are constrained by low-income levels. The study proposes that community-based house improvement initiatives combined with targeted subsidies could lower the financial barriers, improve access to essential construction materials or designs, and significantly accelerate malaria transmission control in these communities. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

Fraser of Canada, ex-cluding those from Allan Hancock Pacific Expeditions and the Allan Hancock Caribbean Sea Expedition. The names of four families, 11 genera, and 101 species are attributed to him in this work, complementing those of another two genera and 164 species described by Fraser in various Allan Hancock publications. Information is provided on type localities of his new species, on locations and kinds of type material in existence, where known, and on the current taxonomic status of families, genera, and species described by him in works reviewed herein. Two replacement names (Thuiaria geniculata Fraser, 1918a and Salacia fraseri Calder, 1991) exist for Thuiaria distans Fraser, 1914a (not Thuiaria distans Allman, 1877). The widely overlooked senior synonym, T. geniculata, is recognized as the valid name of the species. Diphasia alta nom. nov. is proposed as a new replacement name for the permanently invalid junior primary homonym Diphasia robusta Fraser, 1943a (not D. attenuata robusta Billard, 1924). In addition, Cryptolaria crassa nom. nov. is proposed as a new replacement name for the junior secondary homonym Cryptolaria rigida (Fraser, 1948) [not C. rigida (Fraser, 1940a)]. Lectotypes have been designated for 47 of the species to establish objective standards for application of their names. Cory-morpha adventitia Fraser, 1941b, from the Pacific coast of Panama, is assigned to Ralpharia Watson, 1980, as R. adven-titia. No type specimens are known to exist for seven of the species considered, including one holotype (of Hebella eximia Fraser, 1944a) missing from its bottle. Particular attention has been paid to dating and chronology of the 51 publications of Fraser covered in this work. Earlier bibliographic errors are corrected, most notably establishing that the book Distri-bution and relationship in American hydroids was published in early 1947 rather than 1946 as per the title page. \u00a9 2018 Magnolia Press."

Upon completion of metamorphosis the adult fly emerges from the puparium, leaving behind an exuvia that is of potential significance in forensic investigation. The empty puparium is a durable piece of entomological evidence lasting several years. Through the study of chemical compounds, specifically the hydrocarbons of these puparia, it is possible to identify the species, in addition to how long they have been exposed to weathering and for this reason, these parameters can assist forensic entomologists in estimating long-term postmortem interval (minPMI). In corpses that take a relatively longer time to decompose, insects may use the same corpses for several oviposition cycles. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a new method to determine the PMI based on chemical compounds of the puparia from different oviposition cycles of the fly Chrysomya megacephala. The chemical composition of 50 puparia from different cycles of oviposition were evaluated by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 60 compounds were identified ranging from C18 to C34, 38 of those were common to all generations. Our results demonstrate that chemical profiles can be used to differentiate puparia collected from successive cycles, and therefore valuable in the estimation of minPMI. \u00a9 2018 Paula et al."

While it has been overtime used to fulfill the daily need of the community living around it. However that various activities can potential lead to the damage of river ecology that impact to decrease the functions of ecology and the water biota diversity specifically fish. The objective of the present study was to inventory the fish fauna of the Meurebo River, Aceh Barat District, Indonesia. The study was conducted for three months from April to June 2016 at 10 sampling stations along the river and river branches. The fish was caught using various fishing equipment, namely gillnet, casting net, trap, and scope net. The fish samples were transported to the Laboratory of Zoology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences for taxonomic identification. A total of 163 individual of fishes were recorded during the sampling, its belong to 7 orders, 21 families and 32 species. Cyprinidae and Carangidae are predominant in Meurebo River, where Cyprinidae inhibit middle and upstream, while Carangidae inhibits downstream. Two species, Osteochilus kappenii dan Ambassis vachellii were widely distributed. Osteochilus kappenii was recorded in almost sampling station except in station V. Similarly, while A. vachellii was also recorded in almost sampling station except in station II and station IV. In addition, two species of introduced fish were recorded, namely; Oreochromis niloticus dan Trichogaster pectoralis. \u00a9 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

Failure of antimonial drugs to respond in some diffused cutaneous leishmaniasis and HIV/AIDS-leishmaniasis co-infected patients, side effects of these drugs, highly mutilating diagnostic procedures and high health care expense are among the problems associated with leishmaniasis. Control of leishmaniasis requires proper understanding of human parasites transmissions (anthroponotic or zoonotic or both). The aim of this review was to elaborate different ecologies of leishmaniasis based on evidences from previous researches and information from literatures obtained from different sources including PubMed to describe zoonotic leishmaniasis in Ethiopia with possible control methods. Although vectors of leishmaniasis in Ethiopia are not endophelic, night indoor visits of Phlebotomus vectors for possible blood meal on human have been indicated. Thus, application of indoor and domestic residual insecticides spraying, use of insecticide impregnated fine mashed bed net for visceral leishmaniasis, community based manipulation (destruction) and residual insecticide fogging of hyrax-sand fly habitats for cutaneous leishmaniasis are the visible vector and reservoir control methods that can be used for control of these diseases in Ethiopia. Use of repellants during night outdoor activities of people in the endemic areas requires further investigations. \u00a9 2018, Hainan Medical University.

            "text": "Background: Urbanization is a main trend in developing countries and leads to health transition. Although non-communicable diseases are increasing in cities of low-income countries, vector-borne diseases such as malaria, are still present. In the case of malaria, transmission is lower than in rural areas, but is uneven and not well documented. In this study, we wanted to evaluate intra-urban malaria transmission in a West African country (Burkina Faso). Methods: A cross-sectional study on 847 adults (35 to 59 year-old) and 881 children (6 months to 5 year-old) living in 1045 households of four districts (Dogona, Yeguere, Tounouma and Secteur 25) of Bobo-Dioulasso was performed between October and November 2013. The districts were selected according to a geographical approach that took into account the city heterogeneity. Malaria prevalence was evaluated using thick and thin blood smears. Human exposure to Anopheles bites was measured by assessing the level of IgG against the Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide. Adult mosquitoes were collected using CDC traps and indoor insecticide spraying in some houses of the four neighbourhoods. The Anopheles species and Plasmodium falciparum infection rate were determined using PCR assays. Results: In this study, 98.5% of the malaria infections were due to Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria transmission occurred in the four districts. Malaria prevalence was higher in children than in adults (19.2 vs 4.4%), and higher in the central districts than in the peripheral ones (P = 0.001). The median IgG level was more elevated in P. falciparum-infected than in non-infected individuals (P < 0.001). Anopheles arabiensis was the main vector identified (83.2%; 227 of the 273 tested mosquito specimens). Five P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes were caught, and they were all caught in the central district of Tounouma where 28.6% (14/49) of the tested blood-fed mosquito specimens had a human blood meal. Conclusions: This study showed that urban malaria transmission occurred in Bobo-Dioulasso, in all the four studied areas, but mainly in central districts. Environmental determinants primarily explain this situation, which calls for better urban management. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

Minimum development time differences within stages were observed between the meat types (pork/beef), but not the organ types (liver/heart). Daily hyperspectral measurements were conducted and a functional regression was completed to examine the main effects of meat and organ type on daily spectral measurements. The model examined post feeding larval spectral measurements of insects raised on beef liver alone, the effect of those raised on pork compared with those raised on beef, the effect of those raised on heart compared with those raised on liver and the interactional effect of those raised on pork heart compared with those raised on beef liver. The analyses indicated that the spectral measurements of post feeding L. sericata raised on pork and beef organs (liver and heart) are affected by the meat and organ type. \u00a9 2018 Warren et al.

            "text": "Passive acoustic sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for quantifying anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, especially for echolocating bat species. To better assess bat population trends there is a critical need for accurate, reliable, and open source tools that allow the detection and classification of bat calls in large collections of audio recordings. The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings. We developed a convolutional neural network based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats. Our deep learning algorithms were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Europe and labelled by citizen scientists from www.batdetective.org. When compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems, we show significantly higher detection performance of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on bat monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system. Our detection pipeline can be used for the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale. Our proposed pipeline makes only a small number of bat specific design decisions, and with appropriate training data it could be applied to detecting other species in audio. A crucial novelty of our work is showing that with careful, non-trivial, design and implementation considerations, state-of-the-art deep learning methods can be used for accurate and efficient monitoring in audio. \u00a9 2018 Mac Aodha et al."

In this study, female Anopheles gambiae were fed on five host blood sources: ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), binturong (Arctictis binturong), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), jaguar (Panthera onca) and Hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas), while Anopheles coluzzii were fed on three hosts: dromedary (Camelus dromedarius), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) and pig (Sus scrofa). We obtained the MS spectra from 240 engorged mosquito abdomens and selected high quality ones from 72 mosquito abdomens to upgrade our home-made database. We excluded from the analysis any spectra of low quality (n = 80), and the remaining 88 specimens were subjected to a blind test analysis against the home-made database. We obtained 100% correct identification of the blood meal source for the specimens collected, 1, 12 and 24 h post-feeding, whereas for the specimens collected 36 h post-feeding, the correct identification rate decreased dramatically. We confirm here that MALDI-TOF MS can be used to identify the blood meal origin of freshly engorged mosquitoes, which opens new perspectives for further studies, including the impact of the mosquito species on blood meal identification. \u00a9 2018 EDP Sciences."

In this study, we use notification data and disease natural history parameters to estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0) of Zika in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We also obtain estimates of R 0 of dengue from time series of dengue cases in the outbreaks registered in 2002 and 2012 in the city, when DENV-3 and DENV-4 serotypes, respectively, had just emerged. Our estimates of the basic reproduction number for Zika in Rio de Janeiro based on surveillance notifications (R 0 = 2\u00b733, 95% CI: 1\u00b797-2\u00b797) were higher than those obtained for dengue in the city (year 2002: R 0 = 1\u00b770 [1\u00b750-2\u00b702]; year 2012: R 0 = 1\u00b725 [1\u00b718-1\u00b736]). Given the role of Aedes aegypti as vector of both the Zika and dengue viruses, we also derive R 0 of Zika as a function of both dengue reproduction number and entomological and epidemiological parameters for dengue and Zika. Using the dengue outbreaks from previous years allowed us to estimate the potential R 0 of Zika. Our estimates were closely in agreement with our first Zika's R 0 estimation from notification data. Hence, these results validate deriving the potential risk of Zika transmission in areas with recurring dengue outbreaks. Whether transmission routes other than vector-based can sustain a Zika epidemic still deserves attention, but our results suggest that the Zika outbreak in Rio de Janeiro emerged due to population susceptibility and ubiquitous presence of Ae. aegypti.

Cage experiments were conducted to determine what percentage of mosquitoes trying to pass through the netting are actually being caught. The GNT caught 97% of female and 98% of male Anopheles gambiae s.s., as well as 97.5% of female and 98% of male Culex pipiens attempting to cross into a bait chamber adjoining the release cage. During a six day field study, the bedroom windows of 12 homes in Mali were fitted with entry/exit GNTs. Traps without glue were fitted over the inside and outside bedroom windows of an additional 12 homes as a control. A total of 446 An. gambiae s.l. were caught attempting to exit dwellings while 773 An. gambiae s.l. were caught attempting to enter. The number of males and females attempting to exit dwellings were roughly similar (215 and 231 respectively) while there was a slight difference in the number of males and females trying to enter (382 and 430 respectively). Pyrethrum spray catches (PSC's) conducted inside the dwellings on the last day of the experiment yielded only six females and a single male. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Ancient literature and archaeology reveal hermetic sealing, burning sulfur, desiccant dusts, and toxic botanicals as early control methods. Whereas traditional nonchemical methods were subsequently replaced by synthetic chemicals, other traditional methods were improved and integrated with key modern pesticides. Modern stored-product integrated pest management (IPM) makes decisions using knowledge of population dynamics and threshold insect densities. IPM programs are now being fine-tuned to meet regulatory and market standards. Better sampling methods and insights from life histories and ecological studies have been used to optimize the timing of pest management. Over the past 100 years, research on stored-product insects has shifted from being largely concentrated within 10 countries to being distributed across 65 countries. Although the components of IPM programs have been well researched, more research is needed on how these components can be combined to improve effectiveness and assure the security of postharvest food as the human population increases. \u00a9 2017 by Annual Reviews.

ChromID ESBL medium (bioMerieux) was used to select a pool of Enterobacteriaceae strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Drug sensitivity of the chosen strains was determined from the full pool of Enterobacteriaceae to 6 chemotherapeutics of different mechanisms of action. The study evaluated the sensitivity of ESBL-synthesizing isolates to substances belonging to penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamycins, clavams, carbapenems and monobactams. Analysis of the results indicated a potential role of Strix aluco in the dissemination of epidemiologically-relevant Enterobacteriaceae, and, importantly, pose health risks to forest service workers, nature protection service and ornithologists. The results can also serve as the basis for further environmental studies. \u00a9 2017, Institute of Agricultural Medicine. All rights reserved."

            "text": "In dengue-endemic areas, transmission shows both a seasonal and interannual variability. To investigate how rainfall impacts dengue seasonality in Singapore, we carried out a longitudinal survey in the Geylang neighborhood from August 2014 to August 2015. The survey comprised of twice-weekly random inspections to outdoor breeding habitats and continuous monitoring for positive ones. In addition, observations of rainstorms were collected. Out of 6824 inspected habitats, 67 contained Aedes aegypti, 11 contained Aedes albopictus and 24 contained Culex spp. The main outdoors habitat of Aedes aegypti was storm drains (54/67). We found that 80% of breeding sites in drains (43/54) were lost after intense rainstorms related to the wet phase of the Northeast monsoon (NE) between November 2014 and early January 2015. Subsequently, 95% (41/43) of these flushed drains had dried out during the dry phase of the NE in late January-February 2015. A return in the outdoor breeding of Aedes aegypti was observed after the onset of Southwest monsoon (SW) between May and August 2015. There was also a reduction in productivity of breeding habitats for larvae and pupae after the onset of the NE. In wet equatorial regions like Singapore, rainfall varies with the monsoons. A monsoon-driven sequence of flushing and drying shapes the outdoor seasonal abundance of Aedes aegypti. This finding can be used to optimize vector control strategies and better understand dengue in the context of climate change. \u00a9 2016 Seidahmed, Eltahir."

Huge datasets can produce new challenges in interpreting branch support, and new opportunities in developing better models and more sophisticated partitioning schemes. Dating analyses are improving as we recognize the importance of careful fossil calibration selection. With thousands of genes now available, coalescent methods have come of age.

Although the existence of genetic incompatibilities preventing the cross-species transfer may explain host specificity, the existence of vectors with a high preference for a determined host represents another possibility. To test this hypothesis, we undertook a 15-mo-long longitudinal entomological survey in two forest regions of Gabon, where wild apes live, at different heights under the canopy. More than 2,400 anopheline mosquitoes belonging to 18 species were collected. Among them, only three species of Anopheles were found infected with ape Plasmodium: Anopheles vinckei, Anopheles moucheti, and Anopheles marshallii. Their role in transmission was confirmed by the detection of the parasites in their salivary glands. Among these species, An. vinckei showed significantly the highest prevalence of infection and was shown to be able to transmit parasites of both chimpanzees and gorillas. Transmission was also shown to be conditioned by seasonal factors and by the heights of capture under the canopy. Moreover, human landing catches of sylvan Anopheles demonstrated the propensity of these three vector species to feed on humans when available. Our results suggest therefore that the strong host specificity observed in the Laveranias is not linked to a specific association between the vertebrate host and the vector species and highlight the potential role of these vectors as bridge between apes and humans."

            "text": "Background: Mosquito habitat-association studies are an important basis for disease control programmes and/or vector distribution models. However, studies do not explicitly account for incomplete detection during larval presence and abundance surveys, with potential for significant biases because of environmental influences on larval behaviour and sampling efficiency. Methods: Data were used from a dip-sampling study for Anopheles larvae in Ethiopia to evaluate the effect of six factors previously associated with larval sampling (riparian vegetation, direct sunshine, algae, water depth, pH and temperature) on larval presence and detectability. Comparisons were made between: (i) a presence-absence logistic regression where samples were pooled at the site level and detectability ignored, (ii) a success versus trials binomial model, and (iii) a presence-detection mixture model that separately estimated presence and detection, and fitted different explanatory variables to these estimations. Results: Riparian vegetation was consistently highlighted as important, strongly suggesting it explains larval presence (-). However, depending on how larval detectability was estimated, the other factors showed large variations in their statistical importance. The presence-detection mixture model provided strong evidence that larval detectability was influenced by sunshine and water temperature (+), with weaker evidence for algae (+) and water depth (-). For larval presence, there was also some evidence that water depth (-) and pH (+) influenced site occupation. The number of dip-samples needed to determine if larvae were likely present at a site was condition dependent: with sunshine and warm water requiring only two dips, while cooler water and cloud cover required 11. Conclusions: Environmental factors influence true larval presence and larval detectability differentially when sampling in field conditions. Researchers need to be more aware of the limitations and possible biases in different analytical approaches used to associate larval presence or abundance with local environmental conditions. These effects can be disentangled using data that are routinely collected (i.e., multiple dip samples at each site) by employing a modelling approach that separates presence from detectability. \u00a9 2016 Low et al."

            "text": "Assessing body mass in mammals is of importance as it influences virtually all aspects of mammal physiology, behavior and ecological parameters. However, the assessment of body mass of large mammals is potentially dangerous and logistically challenging. Photogrammetry (measurements through the use of photographs) is a well-established science. In zoology it has been used with varying success to estimate the size and mass of some marine and terrestrial mammal species. However, photogrammetric body mass estimation of terrestrial mammals has received comparatively little attention. This is largely due to species' variable morphological attributes which complicates measurement especially if, for 3D orientation, photogrammetric models are dependent on identifiable features on the animals themselves. Ninety-two individuals belonging to 16 terrestrial mammalian species were weighed and photographed for body mass estimation using a volumetric photogrammetry method, purposely applied with commercially available software. This method is not dependent on identifiable body features for 3D orientation. Measured body mass ranged from 25 kg to 4060 kg. Photogrammetric mass estimates versus physically weighed mass was plotted and the goodness of fit assessed for each species. Body size, shape and physiological attributes influence the accuracy of body mass estimation between species (although consistent within species), largely attributed to morphological features (e.g., hair length and posture). This photogrammetric method accurately estimated the body mass of several terrestrial mammal species. It represents innovative use of photographs to create calibrated three-dimensional imagery for accurate quantification of mammalian metrics, specifically body volume and mass. Advances of a method that is not subject to species, sex or age is advantageous and suitable for wide application in our effort to model population demography. \u00a9 2015 Postma et al."

We propose a new larval habitat classification and a new larval sampling methodology. We also report some preliminary results illustrating the applicability of the methodology based on data collected in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest in a longitudinal study of two remote Yanomami communities, Parafuri and Toototobi. In these areas, we mapped and classified 112 natural breeding habitats located in low-order river systems based on their association with river flood pulses, seasonality and exposure to sun. Our classification rendered seven types of larval habitats: lakes associated with the river, which are subdivided into oxbow lakes and nonoxbow lakes, flooded areas associated with the river, flooded areas not associated with the river, rainfall pools, small forest streams, medium forest streams and rivers. The methodology for larval sampling was based on the accurate quantification of the effective breeding area, taking into account the area of the perimeter and subtypes of microenvironments present per larval habitat type using a laser range finder and a small portable inflatable boat. The new classification and new sampling methodology proposed herein may be useful in vector control programs. \u00a9 2015, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz. All rights reserved."

Methods: In total, twenty-nine stations were prospected, through 1 800 Km, including four zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis foci (Ouarzazat, Zagora, Tata and Errachidia). Sand flies were collected using sticky paper traps for one night. Results: Overall, 7 140 sandflies were collected along the three transects. In the combined collections, nine Phlebotomus species: Phlebotomus papatasi (27.6%), Phlebotomus longicuspis (19%), Phlebotomus sergenti (18.2%), Phlebotomus perniciosus (6.2%), Phlebotomus bergeroti (2.9%), Phlebotomus alexandri (1.4%), Phlebotomus chadlii (0.8%), Phlebotomus chabaudi (0.5%) and Phlebotomus ariasi (0.5%) and five Sergentomyia species: Sergentomyia minuta (10.4%), Sergentomyia fallax (8.1%), Sergentomyia dreyfussi (2.1%), Sergentomyia christophersi (1.7%) and Sergentomyia africana (0.5%) were detected. Conclusions: We update the entomological data in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis foci and discuss the possible effect of many ecological factors as bioclimate, biotopes and altitude on the diversity and distribution of caught species. \u00a9 2015 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press."

It has been rapidly emerging in southern Europe since 1998. In mainland Portugal, strains of BTV belonging to three serotypes have been detected: BTV-10 (1956-1960), BTV-4 (2004-2006 and 2013) and BTV-1 (2007-2012). This paper describes the design, implementation and results of the Entomological Surveillance Programme covering mainland Portugal, between 2005 and 2010, including 5,650 caches. Culicoides imicola Kieffer was mostly found in central and southern regions of Portugal, although it was sporadically detected in northern latitudes. Its peak activity occurred in the autumn and it was active during the winter months in limited areas of the country. Obsoletus group was present at the highest densities in the north although they were found throughout the country in substantial numbers. Culicoides activity occurred all year round but peaked in the spring. A generalized linear mixed model was developed for the analysis of the environmental factors associated with activity of the species of Culicoides suspected vectors of BTV in the country. For C. imicola Kieffer, the most important variables were month, diurnal temperature range (DTR), the number of frost days (FRS) and median monthly temperature (TMP). For the Obsoletus group, the most important factors were month, diurnal temperature range (DTR), and linear and quadratic terms for median monthly temperature (TMP). The results reported can improve our understanding of climatic factors in Culicoides activity influencing their distribution and seasonal pattern. \u00a9 2015 Ribeiro et al."

The species and age of maggots or flies that are present at the scene can be used when estimating how much time has passed since death. Current methods that are used to identify species and developmental stage of larvae and fly samples are highly subjective, costly and often time consuming processes and require the expertise of an entomologist or species identification via DNA analysis. The use of vibrational spectroscopy, as an alternative identification method, would allow for a quicker, cheaper and less subjective technique and would allow entomological evidence to be used more commonly in the forensic process. This proof of principle study shows the potential for using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) as a rapid tool for differentiating between various species of larvae, such as those commonly found at crime scenes. The proposed regime would provide a rapid and valuable tool resulting in reduced time for both species identification and life cycle determination, particularly in forensic situations. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Despite this, the temporal dynamics of invasions are poorly understood, with most studies focusing on a single time point, providing us with only a snapshot of the biology and genetics of the invader. We investigated the invasion of Lord Howe Island by the delicate skink Lampropholis delicata and assessed the introduction history and genetic structure of this species over a 5-year period. Using genetic data taken from 2007, and again in 2011/12, we examined changes in the population genetic structure (whether new haplotypes had been introduced to the island, and shifts in haplotype frequencies) of the species on the island between these two time points. No new haplotypes were introduced to the island between 2007 and 2011/12; however, significant shifts in haplotype frequencies across the island were detected. We conclude that the delicate skink is expanding its range into the southern regions of the island and that the haplotype frequencies on Lord Howe Island are still in a state of highly dynamic flux. Our study highlights the importance of considering invasions as dynamic and studying them in such a way that enable us to better manage their impacts [Current Zoology 61 (3): 456\u2013464, 2015]. \u00a9 2015 Current Zoology."

To examine implications of such choices, an analysis was conducted to explore the extent to which disparate landscape models agree in their epidemiological and entomological risk predictions when extrapolated to new regions. Agreement between six literature-drawn landscape models was examined by comparing predicted county-level distributions of either Lyme disease or Ixodes scapularis vector using Spearman ranked correlation. AUC analyses and multinomial logistic regression were used to assess the ability of these extrapolated landscape models to predict observed national data. Three models based on measures of vegetation, habitat patch characteristics, and herbaceous landcover emerged as effective predictors of observed disease and vector distribution. An ensemble model containing these three models improved precision and predictive ability over individual models. A priori assessment of qualitative model characteristics effectively identified models that subsequently emerged as better predictors in quantitative analysis. Both a methodology for quantitative model comparison and a checklist for qualitative assessment of candidate models for extrapolation are provided; both tools aim to improve collaboration between those producing models and those interested in applying them to new areas and research questions. \u00a9 2014 Lorenz et al."

The identification of an attractant that increases capture rates of pocket gophers would greatly assist researchers and pest management professionals alike. Therefore, we tested the attractiveness of four attractants (peanut butter, anise, grapefruit attractant, and carrot) plus a control (no attractant) using uncovered and covered trap sets to determine what impact they have on visitation and capture rates of pocket gophers. We also determined how the impact of cover status and attractants differ across varying weights and gender of pocket gophers. We found no direct effect of any attractant on visitation and capture rates of pocket gophers, nor on the gender of captured individuals. However, when no attractant was used, the number of pocket gophers captured per 100 trap nights was greater when trap sets were uncovered vs. when covered, and capture rates were generally high and consistent when using peanut butter as an attractant. Additionally, we noted that covered trap sets that were baited with peanut butter yielded heavier pocket gopher captures than uncovered trap sets using this same attractant. This is key, given the difficulty associated with capturing older, more experienced individuals. Combined with data from a previous investigation, this suggests that there is no advantage to using any attractant when utilizing uncovered trap sets, but there is likely some benefit to using peanut butter in covered trap sets. \u00a9 2014 Current Zoology."

Analysis of our questionnaire identified three major themes: understanding of forensic entomology, the acceptance and application of forensic entomology in crime scene investigation, and future directions for forensic entomology in Malaysia. We found that only a few experienced crime scene police officers had a meaningful knowledge of forensic entomology and were involved in maggot collecting during crime scene investigation.Objectives: To assess knowledge, attitude, and practice of forensic entomology among relevant practitioners in Malaysia.Methods: A total of 402 relevant practitioners were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding knowledge, attitude and practice of forensic entomology.Results: Half of the respondents had some understanding that forensic entomology is a study of insects found on a dead human body. The study also found that forensic entomology research in Malaysia is mainly to determine the postmortem interval (PMI), to identify the types of flies, and to study insect maturation and succession; particularly of local species. The Malaysian government should be encouraged to play a role through the Department of Education to attract more students to this field and to support academic institutions to formulate research in forensic entomology.Conclusions: Forensic entomology in Malaysia needs improvement of technical knowledge and awareness among relevant practitioners through curriculum development, policy, and training programs."

Recent studies have revealed that consistent within-species variation in behavior (i.e. animal personality) can be imperative for dispersal success, a key stage in the invasion process. Here we investigate the composition and correlation of two important personality traits associated with invasion success, activity and boldness, and how they are connected to sex and individual size in a newly colonised population of the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis in Lake V\u00e4nern, Sweden. We found no effect of sex or size on behavioral expressions of E. sinensis but a clear positive correlation between boldness and activity. In addition, this study generates important baseline data for monitoring behavioral development, and thereby changing ecological impact, of an invading population over time. This has implications for predicting ecological effects of invasive species as well as for managing ecological invasions. \u00a9 2014 Current Zoology."

These are species of ants, bees and wasps that have evolved to invade, survive and reproduce within a host colony of another social species. This is achieved principally by chemical deception that tricks the host workers into treating the invading parasite as their own kin. Achieving levels of acceptance into typically hostile host colonies requires an amazing level of deception as social insects have evolved complex species- and colony-specific recognition systems. This allows the detection of foreigners, both hetero- and con-specific. Therefore, social parasitic ants not only have to overcome the unique species recognition profiles that each ant species produces, but also the subtle variations in theses profiles which generate the colony-specific profiles. We present data on the level of chemical similarity between social parasites and their hosts in four different systems and then discuss these data in the wider context with previous studies, especially in respect to using multivariate statistical methods when looking for differences in these systems. \u00a9 2014 Current Zoology."

This represents a huge effort by more than 400 contributing specialists throughout Europe and is a unique (standard) reference suitable for many users in science, government, industry, nature conservation and education. Helminths parasitic in animals represent a large assemblage of worms, representing three phyla, with more than 200 families and almost 4,000 species of parasites from all major vertebrate and many invertebrate groups. A general introduction is given for each of the major groups of parasitic worms, i.e. the Acanthocephala, Monogenea, Trematoda (Aspidogastrea and Digenea), Cestoda and Nematoda. Basic information for each group includes its size, host-range, distribution, morphological features, life-cycle, classification, identification and recent key-works. Tabulations include a complete list of families dealt with, the number of species in each and the name of the specialist responsible for data acquisition, a list of additional specialists who helped with particular groups, and a list of higher taxa dealt with down to the family level.

The general atmosphere of French zoology during the 1920s and the 1930s will first be recalled, to understand the specific conditions in which Teissier became a zoologist. After a brief overview of his joint work with Philippe L'H\u00e9ritier on the experimental genetics of Drosophila, this article describes the ways Teissier, during the 1950s, conceptualized the mechanisms that could allow for macroevolutionary transitions. \u00a9 2013 by the Genetics Society of America."

Adult zebrafish Danio rerio were maintained under a 12:12 LD cycle (with dim red light serving as reduced visibility during subjective dark hours), and their shoaling behavior was monitored every hours for a three-day period of time. Our results show that zebrafish perform shoaling behavior throughout subjective day and under reduced visibility conditions, although mean shoaling times during the light phase were significantly higher than mean shoaling times during the dark phase. However, on the 3rd day of the experiment, mean shoaling times during the subjective night had increased and mean shoaling times during the subjective day had decreased. This shift in intensity was not seen on the first two days of the study, and may represent the influence of experience on the behavior of the test fish. We believe this study shows that shoaling behavior changes with light/dark cycles and that fish shoal even during reduced visibility conditions \u00a9 2013 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Background: Individuals continuously exposed to malaria gradually acquire immunity that protects from severe disease and high levels of parasitization. Acquired immunity has been incorporated into numerous models of malaria transmission of varying levels of complexity (e.g. Bull World Health Organ 50:347, 1974; Am J Trop Med Hyg 75:19, 2006; Math Biosci 90:385-396, 1988). Most such models require prescribing inputs of mosquito biting rates or other entomological or epidemiological information. Here, we present a model with a novel structure that uses environmental controls of mosquito population dynamics to simulate the mosquito biting rates, malaria prevalence as well as variability in protective immunity of the population. Methods. A simple model of acquired immunity to malaria is presented and tested within the framework of the Hydrology, Entomology and Malaria Transmission Simulator (HYDREMATS), a coupled hydrology and agent-based entomology model. The combined model uses environmental data including rainfall, temperature, and topography to simulate malaria prevalence and level of acquired immunity in the human population. The model is used to demonstrate the effect of acquired immunity on malaria prevalence in two Niger villages that are hydrologically and entomologically very different. Simulations are conducted for the year 2006 and compared to malaria prevalence observations collected from the two villages. Results: Blood smear samples from children show no clear difference in malaria prevalence between the two villages despite pronounced differences in observed mosquito abundance. The similarity in prevalence is attributed to the moderating effect of acquired immunity, which depends on prior exposure to the parasite through infectious bites - and thus the hydrologically determined mosquito abundance. Modelling the level of acquired immunity can affect village vulnerability to climatic anomalies. Conclusions: The model presented has a novel structure constituting a mechanistic link between spatial and temporal environmental variability and village-scale malaria transmission. Incorporating acquired immunity into the model has allowed simulation of prevalence in the two villages, and isolation of the effects of acquired immunity in dampening the difference in prevalence between the two villages. Without these effects, the difference in prevalence between the two villages would have been significantly larger in response to the large differences in mosquito populations and the associated biting rates. \u00a9 2013 Yamana et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The gold-standard approach for mosquito collection is that of human landing catch (HLC), in which an individual exposes bare skin to possibly infected vectors. Here, we present the development of a new method for mosquito collection, the Infoscitex tent, which uses modern tent materials coupled with a novel trap design. This provides an efficacious, a non-labor-intensive, and a safe method for vector collection. In these initial studies, we found it collected an average of 27.7 Anopheles gambiae s.l. per trap per night in rural villages in southeastern Senegal, and 43.8 Culex group V per trap per night in the semiurban town of Kedougou, Senegal. In direct comparisons with HLC, the tent was not statistically different for collection of Culex quinquefasciatus in crepuscular sampling, but was significantly less efficacious at trapping the highly motile dusk-biter Aedes aegypti. These studies suggest that the Infoscitex tent is a viable and safe alternative to HLC for Anopheles and Culex sampling in areas of high vector-borne disease infection risk. \u00a9 2014 Entomological Society of America."

            "text": "Like other small terrestrial mammals, bats have a high mass-specific energetic demand because of the fact that they have an unfavorable surface area to volume ratio. Furthermore, bats have a very energy-expensive mode of locomotion: flight. This high energetic demand has to be covered by food intake. The retention time of the digestive tract is one factor affecting the energy intake of bat species. Factors like energy demand, gut volume and dietary specialization influence retention time in mammals. However, maximum retention time for only Myotis myotis and transit time only for M.lucifugus, Nyctophilius gloudi and Nyctalus noctula is known. This study investigated the maximum retention times and transit times of 10 Central European bat species. It was hypothesized that the level of specialization of the digestive tract, energy-demanding processes and intestine length would affect the retention time of bats. Fluorescence-marked mealworms Tenebrio molitor were used to measure the time between the first ingested mealworm and the first appearance of the marker or the last fluorescing feces, respectively. For the first time, the retention time of 10 insectivorous bat species was measured to determine interspecific differences. Additionally, we measured the retention time of post-lactating female and spermatogenically active male Pipistrellus pipistrellus to determine intraspecific differences. The retention time of bats differed significantly between species and is probably influenced by the level of specialization of the digestive tract. High-level specialization of the digestive tract resulted in short retention times. Furthermore, significant intraspecific differences between post-lactating and spermatogenically active individuals of P.pipistrellus showed that the retention time within a single species might be influenced by energy-demanding processes (e.g. reproduction). \u00a9 2012 The Authors.

            "text": "Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is a primary method of malaria vector control, but its potential impact is constrained by several inherent limitations: spraying must be repeated when insecticide residues decay, householders can tire of the annual imposition and campaign costs are recurrent. Durable lining (DL) can be considered an advanced form of long-lasting IRS where insecticide is gradually released from an aesthetically attractive wall lining material to provide vector control for several years. A multicentre trial was carried out in Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Mali, South Africa and Vietnam to assess the feasibility, durability, bioefficacy and household acceptability of DL, compared to conventional IRS or insecticide-treated curtains (LLITCs), in a variety of operational settings. Methods. This study was conducted in 220 households in traditional rural villages over 12-15 months. In all sites, rolls of DL were cut to fit house dimensions and fixed to interior wall surfaces (usually with nails and caps) by trained teams. Acceptability was assessed using a standardized questionnaire covering such topics as installation, exposure reactions, entomology, indoor environment, aesthetics and durability. Bioefficacy of interventions was evaluated using WHO cone bioassay tests at regular intervals throughout the year. Results: The deltamethrin DL demonstrated little to no decline in bioefficacy over 12-15 months, supported by minimal loss of insecticide content. By contrast, IRS displayed a significant decrease in bioactivity by 6 months and full loss after 12 months. The majority of participants in DL households perceived reductions in mosquito density (93%) and biting (82%), but no changes in indoor temperature (83%). Among those households that wanted to retain the DL, 73% cited protective reasons, 20% expressed a desire to keep theirs for decoration and 7% valued both qualities equally. In Equatorial Guinea, when offered a choice of vector control product at the end of the trial (DL, IRS or LLITCs), DL consistently emerged as the most popular intervention regardless of the earlier household allocation. Conclusions: Just as long-lasting insecticidal nets overcame several of the technical and logistical constraints associated with conventionally treated nets and then went to scale, this study demonstrates the potential of DL to sustain user compliance and overcome the operational challenges associated with IRS. \u00a9 2012 Messenger et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne viral zoonosis of increasing global importance. RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted either through exposure to infected animals or through bites from different species of infected mosquitoes, mainly of Aedes and Culex genera. These mosquitoes are very sensitive to environmental conditions, which may determine their presence, biology, and abundance. In East Africa, RVF outbreaks are known to be closely associated with heavy rainfall events, unlike in the semi-arid regions of West Africa where the drivers of RVF emergence remain poorly understood. The assumed importance of temporary ponds and rainfall temporal distribution therefore needs to be investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: A hydrological model is combined with a mosquito population model to predict the abundance of the two main mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes) involved in RVFV transmission in Senegal. The study area is an agropastoral zone located in the Ferlo Valley, characterized by a dense network of temporary water ponds which constitute mosquito breeding sites. The hydrological model uses daily rainfall as input to simulate variations of pond surface areas. The mosquito population model is mechanistic, considers both aquatic and adult stages and is driven by pond dynamics. Once validated using hydrological and entomological field data, the model was used to simulate the abundance dynamics of the two mosquito species over a 43-year period (1961-2003). We analysed the predicted dynamics of mosquito populations with regards to the years of main outbreaks. The results showed that the main RVF outbreaks occurred during years with simultaneous high abundances of both species. Conclusion/Significance: Our study provides for the first time a mechanistic insight on RVFV transmission in West Africa. It highlights the complementary roles of Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes in virus transmission, and recommends the identification of rainfall patterns favourable for RVFV amplification. \u00a9 2012 Soti et al."

            "text": "A short term field mesocosm experiment was performed in semi-deciduous forest areas of Ivory Coast to assess the impact of a decompacting (Hyperiodrilus africanus, Eudrilidae) and two compacting (Millsonia omodeoi and Dichogaster terraenigrae, Acanthodrilidae) earthworm species on soil properties. These species have been selected for their predominance in the region and their contrasting impact on soil structure. The experimental design consisted of a treatment without worms (control), and treatments with one, two or three species of earthworms. Both compacting and decompacting earthworms increased water infiltration rate in all treatments, with marked impact in H. africanus and M. omodeoi+D. terraenigrae treatments. Interactions between compacting and decompacting species resulted in more large aggregates in comparison to when the compacting species D. terraenigrae was alone. This may be accounted for by their compacting attribute as compacting earthworms are responsible for producing the highest number of large aggregates. The low values of mean weight diameter in treatments combining decompacting and compacting earthworms compared with compacting M. omodeoi one also confirmed the trend of decline in soil compaction in the presence of the decompacting species. These results showed positive impact of species richness on soil structure regulation, which is crucial in ecosystem productivity and support consequently the insurance hypothesis. In fact, this study showed that the preservation of earthworm species belonging to these two contrasting functional groups is essential for the maintenance of stable soil structure regulation in agro-tropical ecosystems. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Background: In the past ten years, the Indian Ocean region has been the theatre of severe epidemics of chikungunya and dengue. These outbreaks coincided with a high increase in populations of Aedes albopictus that outcompete its sister taxon Aedes aegypti in most islands sampled. The objective of this work was to update the entomological survey of the two Aedes species in the island of Madagascar which has to face these arboviroses. Methods. The sampling of Aedes mosquitoes was conducted during two years, from October 2007 to October 2009, in fifteen localities from eight regions of contrasting climates. Captured adults were identified immediately whereas immature stages were bred until adult stage for determination. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using two mtDNA genes, COI and ND5 and trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood (ML) method with the gene time reversible (GTR) model. Experimental infections with the chikungunya virus strain 06.21 at a titer of 10 7.5 pfu/mL were performed to evaluate the vector competence of field-collected mosquitoes. Disseminated infection rates were measured fourteen days after infection by immunofluorescence assay performed on head squashes. Results: The species Aedes aegypti was detected in only six sites in native forests and natural reserves. In contrast, the species Aedes albopictus was found in 13 out of the 15 sites sampled. Breeding sites were mostly found in man-made environments such as discarded containers, used tires, abandoned buckets, coconuts, and bamboo cuts. Linear regression models showed that the abundance of Ae. albopictus was significantly influenced by the sampling region (F = 62.00, p < 2.2 \u00d7 10 -16) and period (F = 36.22, p = 2.548 \u00d7 10 -13), that are associated with ecological and climate variations. Phylogenetic analysis of the invasive Ae. albopictus distinguished haplotypes from South Asia and South America from those of Madagascar, but the markers used were not discriminant enough to discern Malagasy populations. The experimental oral infection method showed that six Ae. albopictus populations exhibited high dissemination infection rates for chikungunya virus ranging from 98 to 100%. Conclusion: In Madagascar, Ae. albopictus has extended its geographical distribution whereas, Ae. aegypti has become rare, contrasting with what was previously observed. Changes are predominantly driven by human activities and the rainfall regime that provide suitable breeding sites for the highly anthropophilic mosquito Ae. albopictus. Moreover, these populations were found to be highly susceptible to chikungunya virus. In the light of this study, Ae. albopictus may have been involved in the recent outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue epidemics in Madagascar, and consequently, control measures should be promoted to limit its current expansion. \u00a9 2012 Raharimalala et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "From insects to mammals, many animals engage in behaviours known to follow cyclic patterns over days (e.g. singing, diving or foraging behaviours). Many of them are regulated by external factors, such as light intensity, and are thus associated with sunrise, sunset or zenith. However, these astronomical events do not occur at the same time everyday: they vary with both the time of the year and the latitude. Logically, therefore, behaviour timing should be recorded relative to these events. Yet, in the field, recording the timing of behaviour is much less difficult with a clock, which is often deemed a suitable common proxy. In this paper, we assess the potential methodological problems associated with analyzing behaviours on the basis of clock time rather than with the actual position of the sun. To demonstrate the important difference between these methods of analysis, we first simulated a behaviour set at sunrise and compared the time of occurrence with the two methods. We then used a dataset, based on a long-term monitoring of hunting behaviour of African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, to reveal how using clock time can result in erroneous assumptions about behaviour. Finally, we investigated the occurrence of sun time records in published field studies. As a majority of them did not take into account the relevance of astronomical events, it is probable that many result in faulty behavioural timings. The model presented can change clock-recorded time into actual deviation from astronomical events to assist current protocols as well as correct the already recorded datasets. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

The purpose of the study is to characterize trends in malaria-related literature from 1990 to 2009 in 11 Asian-Pacific countries that are committed to malaria elimination as a national goal. Methods. A systematic search was conducted for articles published from January 1990 to December 2009 in PubMed/MEDLINE using terms for malaria and 11 target countries (Bhutan, China, North Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vanuatu). The references were collated and categorized according to subject, Plasmodium species, and whether they contained original or derivative data. Results: 2,700 articles published between 1990 and 2009 related to malaria in the target countries. The annual output of malaria-related papers increased linearly whereas the overall biomedical output from these countries grew exponentially. The percentage of malaria-related publications was nearly 3% (111/3741) of all biomedical publications in 1992 and decreased to less than 1% (118/12171; p < 0.001) in 2009. Thailand had the highest absolute output of malaria-related papers (n = 1211), followed by China (n = 609) and Indonesia (n = 346). Solomon Islands and Vanuatu had lower absolute numbers of publications, but both countries had the highest number of publications per capita (1.3 and 2.5 papers/1,000 population). The largest percentage of papers concerned the epidemiology and control of malaria (53%) followed by studies of drugs and drug resistance (47%). There was an increase in the proportion of articles relating to epidemiology, entomology, biology, molecular biology, pathophysiology and diagnostics from the first to the second decade, whereas the percentage of papers on drugs, clinical aspects of malaria, immunology, and social sciences decreased. Conclusions: The proportion of malaria-related publications out of the overall biomedical output from the 11 target Asian-Pacific countries is decreasing. The discovery and evaluation of new, safe and effective drugs and vaccines is paramount. In addition the elimination of malaria will require operational research to implement and scale up interventions. \u00a9 2011 Andersen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

To determine the effects of living on soybean (Glycine max Linnaeus) grown under elevated CO2, population growth of the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) was determined at the SoyFACE research site at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA, grown under elevated (550 \u03bcL/L) and ambient (370 \u03bcL/L) levels of CO2. Growth of aphid populations under elevated CO2 was significantly greater after 1 week, with populations attaining twice the size of those on plants grown under ambient levels of CO2. Soybean leaves grown under elevated levels of CO2 were previously demonstrated at SoyFACE to have increased leaf temperature caused by reduced stomatal conductance. To separate the increased leaf temperature from other effects of elevated CO2, air temperature was lowered while the CO2 level was increased, which lowered overall leaf temperatures to those measured for leaves grown under ambient levels of CO2. Aphid population growth on plants grown under elevated CO2 and reduced air temperature was not significantly greater than on plants grown under ambient levels of CO2. By increasing Glycine max leaf temperature, elevated CO2 may increase populations of Aphis glycines and their impact on crop productivity. \u00a9 2011 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

To alleviate the impairments of SCI, we studied the therapeutic effect of nimodipine (an L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist) on functional recovery from SCI using Nystrom's method in a mouse model. Eighty-four mice were divided into three groups: control group in which only vertebral plates were cut off without causing any spinal injuries; SCI; and SCI with nimodipine treatment. We assessed the histopathology, apoptosis detection, cell cycle, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, bcl-2/bax and caspase-3 levels of tissue 8 h, 1 d, 3 d and 4 d after trauma to evaluate rehabilitation. Behavioral performances were also assessed before and after nimodipine treatment. Results from inclined plane tests, motor score assessment and histological observations indicated that mice in the nimodipine-treated group rehabilitated better than those in the SCI group. The ratio of apoptosis, caspase-3 and bax expression in the nimodipine- treated group were significantly lower than those in the SCI group. The mitochondrial membrane potential and bcl-2 expression were up-regulated in the nimodipine-treated group. Taken together, our results indicate that the inhibition of calcium flux by nimodipine could reduce apoptosis processes and tissue damage through a mitochondrial pathway after spinal cord trauma. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Molecular dating techniques require the use of calibrations, which are usually fossil or geological vicariance-based. Fossil calibrations have been criticised because they result only in minimum age estimates. Based on a historical biogeographic perspective, I suggest that vicariance-based calibrations are more dangerous. Almost all analytical methods in historical biogeography are strongly biased towards inferring vicariance, hence vicariance identified through such methods is unreliable. Other studies, especially of groups found on Gondwanan fragments, have simply assumed vicariance. Although it was previously believed that vicariance was the predominant mode of speciation, mounting evidence now indicates that speciation by dispersal is common, dominating vicariance in several groups. Moreover, the possibility of speciation having occurred before the said geological event cannot be precluded. Thus, geological calibrations can under- or overestimate times, whereas fossil calibrations always result in minimum estimates. Another major drawback of vicariant calibrations is the problem of circular reasoning when the resulting estimates are used to infer ages of biogeographic events. I argue that fossil-based dating is a superior alternative to vicariance, primarily because the strongest assumption in the latter, that speciation was caused by the said geological process, is more often than not the most tenuous. When authors prefer to use a combination of fossil and vicariant calibrations, one suggestion is to report results both with and without inclusion of the geological constraints. Relying solely on vicariant calibrations should be strictly avoided. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

Tourists often engage in wildlife photography, an activity that is generally not considered disturbing to animals. We investigated the effects of camera- related stimuli to determine whether shutter noise and/or flash affected the immediate behavior of female crested anoles Anolis cristaellus. Anoles decreased their display rate following stimuli that included shutter noises, but did not change their behavior in response to flash or silence treatments. To determine the relative importance of this response, we observed anole behavior following playbacks of calls from kestrels Falco sparverius, a predator, and bananaquits Coereba flaveola, a non-predator. Anoles decreased display rates following kestrel calls when compared to their response to bananaquit calls. Furthermore, anoles spent a greater proportion of time displaying following bananaquit calls compared to both kestrel calls and silence. The magnitude of response to shutter noises was about the same as that to predator calls. This demonstrates that photography may not be as benign as commonly believed, and we should consider whether restrictions on camera noises should be implemented to reduce animal disturbance. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

Results suggest that alopecia is commonly observed in Japanese macaques, with 20.5% of individuals showing head alopecia and 4.7% showing back alopecia across eight study groups. Alopecia was more commonly observed in adult females (30.8% individuals showing head alopecia and 15.3% showing back alopecia) than in other age-sex classes. Seasonal variation of back alopecia was noted, in particular, individuals with patchy back hair were more frequently observed in winter than in summer. Seasonal variation was not observed in head hair. The distribution of alopecia was also different among study groups. The wild population generally had better hair condition than provisioned populations and captive populations. The present study used a non-invasive alopecia scoring system which can be a useful, rapid and non-invasive tool to monitor animal health and well-being at a population level. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

Responses varied with insect species, dosage and exposure time. In the dry film contact experiment, the highest insecticidal effects of calamusenone against S. zeamais and R. dominica adults were produced at 170.32 \u03bcg/cm2 after treatment for 72 h, with 96.2% and 98.7% mortalities, respectively. The median lethal concentration (LC50) (72 h) values of calamusenone against S. zeamais and R. dominica adults were 67.00 \u03bcg/cm2 and 77.30 \u03bcg/cm2, respectively. As a potential fumigant, calamusenone showed moderate insecticidal effect on the adults of S. zeamais and R. dominica in fumigation experiment, with their LC50 (120 h) values of 125.71 \u03bcL/L and 93.64 \u03bcL/L respectively. Calamusenone isolated from A. gramineus rhizome showed promise as a novel pesticide candidate for stored-product pest control. \u00a9 2010 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

Like other disturbances, fire may spread from a local epicenter with a propagation rate enhanced or retarded by the spatial arrangement of fuel across the landscape. Therefore, fire ignition and spread are a direct consequence of the presence and arrangement of fire-prone habitats. Generalizing the concept of \"habitat selection\" to every spatially distributed ecological process, the resource selection functions used in zoology to summarize habitat use by wildlife can be also used to characterize the wildfire's pattern across the landscape. The aim of this paper is thus to quantify the relationship between forest cover and burnt area in Canton Ticino (Switzerland) during 1980-2007 using a bootstrap test of significance: that is, to identify forest types that burn more (or less) than expected from a random null model based on the regional availability of the resource (forest type). The results show that fires behave selectively for most forest types; whereas chestnut stands and broad-leaved forests display overproportional burnt areas, coniferous forests typically burn less than expected by a random null model. \u00a9 2011."

            "text": "Background. Knockdown resistance (kdr) caused by a single base pair mutation in the sodium channel gene is strongly associated with pyrethroid insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae in West-Central Africa. Recently, various molecular techniques have been developed to screen for the presence of the kdr mutations in vector populations with varying levels of accuracy. In this study, the results of the hydrolysis probe analysis for detecting the kdr mutations in An. gambiae s.s. from the Republic of the Congo were compared with DNA sequence analysis. Methods. A total of 52 pyrethroid and DDT resistant An. gambiae from Pointe-Noire (Congo-Brazzaville) were tested for detection of the two kdr mutations (kdr-e and kdr-w) that are known to occur in this species. Results from the hydrolysis probe analysis were compared to DNA sequencing to verify the accuracy of the probe analysis for this vector population. Results. Fifty-one specimens were found to be An. gambiae S-form and one was a M/S hybrid. DNA sequencing revealed that more than half of the specimens (55.8%) carried both the kdr-e and kdr-w resistance mutations, seven specimens (13.5%) were homozygous for the kdr-e mutation, and 14 specimens (26.9%) were homozygous for the kdr-w mutation. A single individual was genotyped as heterozygous kdr-e mutation (1.9%) only and another as heterozygous kdr-w mutation (1.9%) only. Analysis using hydrolysis probe analysis, without adjustment of the allelic discrimination axes on the scatter plots, revealed six specimens (11.5%) carrying both mutations, 30 specimens (57.8%) as homozygous kdr-w, six specimens (11.5%) homozygous for the kdr-e mutation, one specimen (1.9%) heterozygous for the kdr-w mutation and one specimen (1.9%) present in wild type form. Eight of the specimens (15.4%) could not be identified using unadjusted hydrolysis probe analysis values. No heterozygous kdr-e mutations were scored when adjustment for the allelic discrimination axes was omitted. However, when the axes on the scatter plots were adjusted the results were consistent with those of the DNA sequence analysis, barring two individuals that were mis-scored in the hydrolysis probe analysis. Conclusion. Both the kdr-e and kdr-w mutations were abundant in An. gambiae S-form from Pointe-Noire. The hydrolysis probe analysis can lead to misleading results if adjustment to allelic discrimination axes is not investigated. This is mainly relevant when both kdr-e and kdr-w are present in a population in a high frequency. This report highlights the importance of concurrent screening for both mutations. Therefore, performing routine assay protocols blindly can result in the misinterpretation of results. Although hydrolysis probe analysis of kdr is still held as the gold standard assay, this paper highlights the importance of kdr mutation confirmation via sequencing especially in regions where kdr frequency has never been reported before or where both the kdr-e and kdr-w mutations are present simultaneously. \u00a9 2010 Choi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In the first orchard, all three spray treatments and non-sprayed controls were distributed separately among individual trees in one block, whereas in the second orchard the control, HMO and methidathion treatments were applied at the level of whole blocks. The results in both orchards were similar. All three of the spray treatments had a lethal effect on the red scale insects and the effects of HMO and methidathion tested at the second site lasted for at least 19 weeks and for purple scale, at least 50 weeks. HMO did not have a significant effect on the abundance and species diversity of parasitoids and (for the most part) did not affect coccinellids and predatory mites. Both carbaryl and methidathion caused significant ongoing disruption to the above groups. No treatment resulted in the resurgence of the scale insects or the outbreak of phytophagous mites, even where whole blocks were sprayed. \u00a9 2010 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

            "text": "In December 2006, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was diagnosed in humans in Garissa Hospital, Kenya and an outbreak reported affecting 11 districts. Entomologic surveillance was performed in four districts to determine the epidemic/epizootic vectors of RVF virus (RVFV). Approximately 297,000 mosquitoes were collected, 164,626 identified to species, 72,058 sorted into 3,003 pools and tested for RVFV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Seventy-seven pools representing 10 species tested positive for RVFV, including Aedes mcintoshi/circumluteolus (26 pools), Aedes ochraceus (23 pools), Mansonia uniformis (15 pools); Culexpoicilipes, Culex bitaeniorhynchus (3 pools each); Anopheles squamosus, Mansonia africana (2 pools each); Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex univittatus, Aedes pembaensis (1 pool each). Positive Ae. pembaensis, Cx. univittatus, and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus was a first time observation. Species composition, densities, and infection varied among districts supporting hypothesis that different mosquito species serve as epizootic/epidemic vectors of RVFV in diverse ecologies, creating a complex epidemiologic pattern in East Africa.

Singapore has been certified malaria free since November 1982 by the World Health Organization and despite occasional local transmission, the country has maintained the standing. In 2009, three clusters of malaria cases were reported in Singapore. Methods. Epidemiological, entomological and molecular studies were carried out to investigate the three clusters, namely Mandai-Sungei Kadut, Jurong Island and Sembawang. Results. A total of 29 malaria patients, with no recent travel history, were reported in the three clusters. Molecular analysis based on the msp3 and msp1 genes showed two independent local transmissions: one in Mandai-Sungei Kadut and another in Sembawang. Almost all cases within each cluster were epidemiologically linked. In Jurong Island cluster, epidemiological link remains uncertain, as almost all cases had a unique genetic profile. Only two cases shared a common profile and were found to be linked to the Mandai-Sungei Kadut cluster. Entomological investigation found Anopheles sinensis to be the predominant Anopheline in the two areas where local transmission of P. vivax was confirmed. Anopheles sinensis was found to be attracted to human bait and bites as early as 19:45 hrs. However, all Anopheles mosquitoes caught were negative for sporozoites and oocysts by dissection. Conclusion. Investigation of P. vivax cases from the three cluster areas confirmed the occurrence of local transmission in two areas. Although An. sinensis was the predominant Anopheline found in areas with confirmed transmission, the vector/s responsible for the outbreaks still remains cryptic. \u00a9 2010 Ng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The goal of environmental enrichment is to stimulate captive animals to exhibit similar foraging behavior of their wild counterparts, e.g. to extend foraging time. We conducted a 12-month study on the foraging behavior of Japanese macaques in a semi-naturally forested enclosure to understand how they use both provisioned foods and naturally available plant foods and what are the nutritional criteria of their consumption of natural plants. We recorded time spent feeding on provisioned and natural plant foods and collected the plant parts ingested of their major plant food species monthly, when available. We conducted nutritional analysis (crude protein, crude lipid, neutral detergent fiber-'NDF', ash) and calculated total nonstructural carbohydrate- 'TNC' and total energy of those food items. Monkeys spent 47% of their feeding time foraging on natural plant species. The consumption of plant parts varied significantly across seasons. We found that leaf items were consumed in months when crude protein, crude protein-to-NDF ratio, TNC and total energy were significantly higher and NDF was significantly lower, fruit/nut items in months when crude protein and TNC were significantly higher and crude lipid content was significantly lower, and bark items in months when TNC and total energy were higher and crude lipid content was lower. This preliminary investigation showed that the forested enclosure allowed troop members to more fully express their species typical flexible behavior by challenging them to adjust their foraging behavior to seasonal changes of plant item diversity and nutritional content, also providing the possibility for individuals to nutritionally enhance their diet. \u00a9 2010 Current Zoology."

Special emphasis is given to the role of the biogenic amine octopamine and biochemical cascades it activates in the eyes. In addition to reviewing published data, we present new data showing that octopamine elevates cAMP levels in Limulus lateral eyes, and we partially characterize the pharmacology of the receptors involved in this response. We also present new data showing that octopamine regulates gene expression in Limulus lateral eyes by activating a cAMP cascade. \u00a9 2010 Current Zoology."

Among the 20 monkeys examined, 8 were right-handed, 8 were left-handed, and 4 were ambilateral. The results indicated the prevailed hand preference on individual level but not either trends of left- or right-hand preference on population level. The trend toward a higher proportion of left-handed monkeys found in Japanese and rhesus monkeys was not found.

The full-length CfMRSP complementary DNA (cDNA) encoded a 43 kDa protein that contained a trypsin-like serine protease catalytic domain, but no clip domain. The C-terminal extension contained five cystein residues, which may allow the protein to form a homodimer through interchain disulfide bonds and regulate the activity of CfMRSP. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that CfMRSP clusters with lepidopteran homologues such as serine protease 1 of Lonomia obliqua, hemolymph proteinase 20 (HP20), pattern recognition serine proteinase precursor (ProHP14) and a trypsin-like protein of Manduca sexta. Northern blot analysis of developmental expression of CfMRSP indicated that its transcripts were found primarily in the epidermis and were produced during all of the tested stadia, from 4th instar larvae to pupae, but increased levels of CfMRSP transcripts were always found after each molt. A high level of the protein was found in the epidermis by immunohistochemistry analysis. Altogether these data suggest that CfMRSP plays a role in the epidermis during molting and metamorphosis. \u00a9 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

Lion cubs at Chipangali were not behaviorally enriched. Activity patterns were recorded for 10 days at each site. We recorded moving, resting, playing, grooming, visual exploration and display of hunting instincts. We found that behavioral enrichment enhanced the active behaviors of captive lion cubs. Orphan-raised cubs spent more time moving, playing and displaying hunting instincts than mother-raised cubs, but the time spent grooming was similar across areas and suggests that grooming is not influenced by enrichment. Mother-raised cubs spent more time engaged in visual exploration than orphan-raised cubs and this could be a behavior acquired from mothers or a result of confidence to explore because of their presence. Activity patterns were different among time treatments across our three study sites. Based on these findings, we suggest that lion cubs raised in captivity could benefit from behavioral enrichment to encourage active behaviors essential for eventual reintroduction into the wild. \u00a9 2010 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Although concerns about harvesting levels of the American Horseshoe Crab, Limulus polyphemus have prompted increased research into its ecology, current understanding of the species' foraging ecology is mostly limited to mid-Atlantic populations. This study elucidates the spatial and temporal pattern of Limulus foraging on an intertidal mudflat of a northern New England estuary. A novel survey method was used to monitor Limulus foraging activity without disturbing the sediment. A fixed 50 m\u00d72 m transect was monitored with monthly surveys of the number of Limulus feeding pits from June to October 2009, May and June 2010. Snorkelling surveys were also carried out to observe individual behavior and examine the spatial scale of activity of individual animals. Results showed frequent and intensive use of the mudflat by foraging Limulus. Limulus were actively foraging within the survey area during all months surveyed. Foraging patterns exhibited a seasonal pattern with activity levels peaking in August 2009 and increased significantly towards the end of the study in June 2010. It was also shown that Limulus intertidal foraging persisted and peaked after the spring breeding season. Observations of foraging Limulus revealed that individual predators dig multiple pits within a single high tide, with little disturbance to the sediment in between. In addition to altering the perception of Limulus as a subtidal predator outside of the breeding season, findings from this study suggests a segregation of spawning and feeding habitats, thus underscoring the need to consider a wider range of critical habitats in the management of Limulus populations [Current Zoology 56 (5): 611-617, 2010]. \u00a9 2010 Current Zoology."

The effect of the sex pheromone components of the lepidopteran olive pests Prays oleae (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) and Palpita unionalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was studied under laboratory conditions, on the foraging behaviour of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma oleae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). The response of T. oleae wasps to (Z)-7-tetradecenal and (E)-11-hexadecenal, major sex pheromone components of P. oleae and P. unionalis respectively, depended on the dose of the pheromone used in a Y-tube olfactometer bioassay. (E)-11-hexadecenal elicited maximum attraction (70%) at a dose of 1 \u03bcg, while a dose of 100 \u03bcg (Z)-7-tetradecenal attracted 80% of the tested wasps. (E)-11-hexadecenyl acetate, the second sex pheromone component of P. unionalis, and the binary blend of (E)-11-hexadecenyl acetate: (E)-11-hexadecenal (7:3) were not attractive at these doses. The results of this research are discussed in view that they may be considered as alternatives in the biological control of these pests. \u00a9 2009 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

In last twenty years, the sea eagle population in South Bohemia was restored by strict protection subsidized by reintroduction. The active help consisted of feeding during winter and building of artificial nests. A new sea eagle breeding population arose in the T\u0159ebo\u0148 basin area in the early 1980's. Until this time sea eagles had used former breeding places only for wintering, probably coming from the Baltic. The South Bohemian sea eagle population is very unique: it exists in a densely man-occupied landscape, mainly in areas with very intensive carp breeding in artificial fishponds and was partly artficially (help to wintering birds and reintroduction of some individuals) restored. The experience from South Bohemia may have importance for populations of the sea eagle in other areas of its occurence, primarily in the continental conditions. \u00a9 2009 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Background. The Camargue region is a former malaria endemic area, where potential Anopheles vectors are still abundant. Considering the importation of Plasmodium due to the high number of imported malaria cases in France, the aim of this article was to make some predictions regarding the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue. Methods. Receptivity (vectorial capacity) and infectivity (vector susceptibility) were inferred using an innovative probabilistic approach and considering both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Each parameter of receptivity (human biting rate, anthropophily, length of trophogonic cycle, survival rate, length of sporogonic cycle) and infectivity were estimated based on field survey, bibliographic data and expert knowledge and fitted with probability distributions taking into account the variability and the uncertainty of the estimation. Spatial and temporal variations of the parameters were determined using environmental factors derived from satellite imagery, meteorological data and entomological field data. The entomological risk (receptivity/infectivity) was calculated using 10,000 different randomly selected sets of values extracted from the probability distributions. The result was mapped in the Camargue area. Finally, vulnerability (number of malaria imported cases) was inferred using data collected in regional hospitals. Results. The entomological risk presented large spatial, temporal and Plasmodium species-dependent variations. The sensitivity analysis showed that susceptibility, survival rate and human biting rate were the three most influential parameters for entomological risk. Assessment of vulnerability showed that among the imported cases in the region, only very few were imported in at-risk areas. Conclusion. The current risk of malaria re-emergence seems negligible due to the very low number of imported Plasmodium. This model demonstrated its efficiency for mosquito-borne diseases risk assessment. \u00a9 2008 Pon\u00e7on et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Taking advantage of a lack of crossing over in females, reciprocal backcrossed F1(BC1) progeny were used for linkage analysis and mapping of the C gene using silkworm strains C108 and KY, which spin white and yellow cocoons, respectively. DNA was extracted from individual pupae and analyzed for simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The C gene was found to be linked to seven SSR markers. All the yellow cocoon individuals from a female heterozygous backcross (BC1F) showed a heterozygous profile for SSR markers on linkage group 12, whereas individuals with light yellow cocoons showed the homozygous profile of the strain C108. Using a reciprocal heterozygous male backcross (BC1M), we constructe a linkage map of 36.4 cM with the C gene located at the distal end, and the closest SSR marker at a distance of 13.9 cM. \u00a9 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

Despite the wealth of literature and anecdotal reports, few investigators have quantified the interactions of bats with mist nets directly. We employed night vision camcorders to monitor bat behavior when bats encountered a mist net and then utilized these data to re-evaluate years of survey data collected on Montserrat, Lesser Antilles. We recorded 2,523 bat passes during 43.3 hours of videotaping in July 2005 and June 2006. Observations conducted on successive nights provide evidence of avoidance-learning behavior in bats. When a mist net was present, 5.4% of bats in the airspace came into contact with the net giving an overall capture rate of 3.2% (range 0-10.3%). Mist nets are not accurately sampling bats that utilize flyways on Montserrat and such fieldwork thereby generates potentially misleading data. Biodiversity assessments and conservation guidelines based on short-term mist net surveys alone are not sufficient or reliable in regards to bats. A pragmatic solution to reduce mist net bias is to repeatedly sample a target region, utilize a variety of netting sites, use variable net sets, and carefully analyze species accumulation curves. \u00a9 Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS."

Unlike in the southern forested areas where the epidemiology of malaria has been better studied prior to the implementation of control activities, little is known about the distribution and role of anophelines in malaria transmission in the coastal areas. Methods. A 12-month longitudinal entomological survey was conducted in Tiko, Limbe and Idenau from August 2001 to July 2002. Mosquitoes captured indoors on human volunteers were identified morphologically. Species of the Anopheles gambiae complex were identified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mosquito infectivity was detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR. Malariometric indices (plasmodic index, gametocytic index, parasite species prevalence) were determined in three age groups (<5 yrs, 5-15 yrs, >15 yrs) and followed-up once every three months. Results. In all, 2,773 malaria vectors comprising Anopheles gambiae (78.2%), Anopheles funestus (17.4%) and Anopheles nili (7.4%) were captured. Anopheles melas was not anthropophagic. Anopheles gambiae had the highest infection rates. There were 287, 160 and 149 infective bites/person/year in Tiko, Limbe and Idenau, respectively. Anopheles gambiae accounted for 72.7%, An. funestus for 23% and An. nili for 4.3% of the transmission. The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia was 41.5% in children <5 years of age, 31.5% in those 5-15 years and 10.5% in those >15 years, and Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant parasite species. Conclusion. Malaria transmission is perennial, rainfall dependent and An. melas does not contribute to transmission. These findings are important in the planning and implementation of malaria control activities in coastal Cameroon and West Africa. \u00a9 2007 Bigoga et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Some kind of actual accomplishment motivates most of the questions, though a considerable number of them have knowledge and understanding as their objective.

Furthermore, the nutritional intake of larvae is likely to vary subject to the part of a corpse on which they are feeding. A study was therefore conducted to investigate the effect of type of food substrate on larval growth in two species of forensically important Australian blowflies. After collection on sheep's liver in the laboratory, different groups of larvae of Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) and Calliphora augur (Fabricius) were grown on sheep's liver, meat, and brains, and their body lengths compared. Results indicated that the development of larvae fed sheep's liver was adversely affected compared with larvae fed meat and brain; they moulted later, reached maximum length more slowly and sometimes produced significantly smaller pupae. These findings, similar to those of another recent study, have obvious implications for postmortem interval determinations. Estimates may be considerably skewed if the site of collection of larvae at a death scene contains tissue types different to those used in reference experiments. We therefore recommend caution in forensic analyses that interpret crime scene data using developmental studies performed with a single type of larval food substrate.

Tadarida teniotis proved to be a late emerger, leaving the roost about one hour after sunset and, in contrast to most insectivorous bat species, only had one foraging bout. These bouts were very long, lasting an average of 6 hours and 39 minutes. Bout duration was unrelated to climatic conditions and so probably determined by foraging success. In the early evening almost all bats were foraging, but this activity declined steadily through the night. They kept flying even during fairly cold nights, but did not leave the roost on the coldest nights, in which they probably remained in torpor. As predicted by its body mass and wing morphology, T. teniotis was found to be a strong flyer, reaching speeds of over 50 km/h, and flying for up to 10 hours without resting periods. The observed speeds were 2.5 times higher than the predicted maximum range speed, which may be possible due to peculiar adaptations to high-speed flight. On most nights bats flew straight to a previously identified feeding site, but on a few they made slower indirect flights, suggesting a search for profitable foraging areas. Upon arriving to a feeding site most bats remained there for the rest of the foraging trip. The median size of these sites was just over 100 ha. Several tracked bats used the same feeding area simultaneously. The range of the colony had a radius of over 30 km, but most feeding sites were concentrated in a mountainous region located about 5 km north of the roost. The studied bats foraged preferentially over forested areas, particularly pine and cork oak woodlands. They used both alluvial plains and the valleys of a mountainous area, but not its ridges. Our observations support the hypothesis that T. teniotis is an opportunistic forager, depending on temporary concentrations of prey, such as insect swarms. \u00a9 Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS."

Phlebotomine sandflies were captured with Falc\u00e3o traps from October 1998 to April 2000 in the Recanto Marista district, Doutor Camargo municipality, Paran\u00e1 State. The results were compared with those from October 1996 to September 1997. In this survey, 122,616 phlebotomine sandflies were captured using 10 traps, as compared to 157,983 in the previous period, with 6 traps. Lutzomyia neivai predominated in both periods. During the former period an hourly average of 1,641.9 phlebotomine sandflies were captured as compared to 806.7 in the latter. The results with four traps installed in the same locations shows that the hourly average was 1,318.8 in the former period and 156.0 in the latter. The large reduction in the number of phlebotomine sandflies captured in the second period may be due to the impact of alterations in the environment and the disinsectization of the buildings after the first period."

Genotype IV viruses (responsible for the European branch of the first panzootic) dominated the scene up to the early 1980s, interspersed with sporadic outbreaks caused by genotype II (US strains causing pneumoencephalitis) viruses. Genotype V viruses (transmitted by psittacines from South America) were first shown in 1973 and persisted until the late 1980s. Genotype VI (earliest members from the Middle-East 1968/70 outbreaks) was represented by scattered isolations between 1974 and 1996. A genotype VIIb (recent Middle East epizootic) virus was isolated as early as in 1984. Newcastle disease epizootics in Bulgaria were highlighted by multiple infection with more than one genotype at any one time."

Six species of moths misidentified by Linnaeus as butterflies are cited in the study, but details are not included. One hundred and fifty-two lectotypes have been designated, representing about 56% of the sum of the valid names and junior synonyms. Of these, 99 were selected from specimens in the Linnean Society of London, 52 from Queen Ludovica Ulrica's collection, Uppsala, and one lectotype is a Petiver specimen from the collection of Sir Hans Sloane. Linnaeus described at least five species, possibly eight, from the literature alone. All Linnaean material examined is documented, as are 'subsequent' specimens that are associated with Linnaean material. Synonymy and homonymy are discussed and presented, as are the identities of type localities. Care has been taken to achieve a practical balance between Linnaean and current species identities. Linnaean material studied included specimens from The Linnean Society of London, Museum Ludovicae Ulricae (Uppsala University), the Clerck and De Geer collections in the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, Stockholm, and the collection of James Petiver, now part of the collection of Sir Hans Sloane housed in The Natural History Museum, London. \u00a9 2001 The Linnean Society of London."

In 1886, with the establishment of the Experimental Farms system, James Fletcher, the Dominion entomologist and botanist, and his colleagues inherited the task of promoting insecticides to orchardists and others. In 1898-1900, in response to the arrival in Ontario of the San Jose scale, Canada and Ontario adopted laws mandating the use of insecticides, as sprays and fumigants, in orchards and at plant quarantine stations. To meet the resulting demand for trained technicians and scientifically-minded farmers, the institutions of applied entomology federally and at the Ontario Agricultural College were further developed. In 1910, after a decade of rapid diffusion of insecticides, Parliament adopted the Destructive Insects and Pest Act, thus creating a national system of horticultural hygiene."

A census was undertaken of the population, after which the entomological survey was performed regarding the dwelling units and serological evaluation of the human population. Blood samples were collected by digital puncture in filter paper. The first serologic test performed to detect antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi was the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFI) with 1/20 positive dilution as cut-off point and, positive samples were further evaluated with indirect hemagglutination reaction (HAI). The prevalence of positive IFI reactions was 12.3% (95%CL: 11.5-13.2). Triatoma infestans was not found within the dwellings. The absence of infection among individuals younger than 14 years and, the absence of T. infestans during the last entomological survey demonstrates the success of the control program of Chagas' disease in the studied area where the vectorial transmission can be considered to have been interrupted."

            "text": "Multiple studies indicate that quantitative control of the levels of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in the vertebrate embryo is necessary for correct development. The function of RA in cells is regulated by a number of coordinated mechanisms. One of those mechanisms involves controls on the rate of RA catabolism. Recently, enzymes capable of catabolizing RA were found to constitute a new family, called CYP26, within the cytochrome P450 superfamily. CYP26 homologues have been isolated from human, mouse, zebra fish, and recently from the chick. In this study, we examined the regulation of chicken CYP26 (cCYP26) expression by RA during the early phase of chick limb outgrowth. In the anterior limb mesenchyme and apical ectodermal ridge (AER), cCYP26 expression was induced in a concentration dependent manner by implanting beads soaked in 0.1, 1, and 5 mg/ml RA. The RA-induced expression of cCYP26 in anterior limb mesenchyme and the AER was detected as early as i hr after treatment and was not affected by the presence of cycloheximide. In contrast to the anterior limb, the induction of cCYP26 was dramatically reduced (or absent) when RA beads were implanted in the posterior limb mesenchyme. Furthermore, induction of cCYP26 expression in the anterior mesenchyme was inhibited by transplantations of the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and by Shh-soaked beads. Our data suggest that different mechanisms regulate retinoid homeostasis in the AER and mesenchyme during limb bud outgrowth. \u00a9 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

            "text": "Fiber identification has been a very important task in many industries such as wool growing, textile processing, archaeology, histochemical engineering, and zoology. Over the years, animal fibers have been identified using physical and chemical approaches. Recently, objective identification of animal fibers has developed based on the cuticular information of fibers. Effective and accurate extraction of representative features is essential to animal fiber identification and classification. In the current work, two different strategies are developed for this purpose. In the first method, explicit features are extracted using image processing. However, only implicit features are used in the second method with an unsupervised artificial neural network. It is found that the use of explicit features increases the accuracy of fiber identification but requires more effort on processing images and solid knowledge of what features are representative ones."

Martha Maxwell, whose diorama of Colorado's wildlife became the most talked about exhibit at the nation's Centennial Exhibition in 1876 was the first true practitioner of modern taxidermy. Known to leading biologists of the day, her collections documented fauna of the West even as expansionism was causing it rapidly to disappear. Louise Kellogg was the first American woman to publish scientific papers on mammals. Interested in both fossil and Recent taxa, she and her companion of 40 years, Annie Alexander, explored western North America from Alaska to Baja California. The specimens they collected, and the notes and photographs they assembled, serve as an irreplaceable historical record of the flora and fauna of western North America in the first half of this century. As founder and benefactress of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, Annie Alexander's vision and commitment to the establishment of a research-based museum of natural history in California laid the foundation for a program of research, education, conservation, and collections management that has served as a model for similar museums nationwide. Knowledge about the lives of these extraordinary women provides a context for understanding and appreciating the achievements of all female mammalogists who have succeeded them."

In BmN4 cells infected with each ts mutant, occlusion bodies were produced normally, but extracellular virus was produced in reduced amounts at 33\u00b0C. The ts mutant adsorption properties of TS3 were similar to the wild type but TS1 and TS2 showed lower levels. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that some polypeptides synthesized in the cells infected with TS2 and TS3 were different from those of the wild type virus. In these ts mutants, such alterations did not depend on the incubation temperature of cultured cells. Restriction endonuclease analysis of viral DNA of ts mutants suggested that most of the mutations occurred in the regions where homologous regions of BmNPV were localized, and the positions of these regions on the genome were similar to those of AcMNPV ts mutants. \u00a9 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

Using this rearing method, the survival rate and developmental speed until eclosion, sex ratio and body length of resultant adults, and the adult age-specific survival rate and fecundity were examined under two temperature conditions. Of the five chrysopid species (Chrysoperla cornea, Mallada alcestes, Mallada boninensis, Chrysopa septempunctata, Chrysopa formosa) that could be reared successively, Cp. camea and M. alcestes were found to be suitable for successive mass production. To compare their rm values, Cp. carnea and M. alcestes were reared on eggs of T. castaneum and on a 2 : 3 mixture of Amber BYF Series 100\u00aeand honey at 26\u00b0\u00b10.5\u00b0C under a 16L : 8D photoperiod. The rm values were 0.12 for Cp. camea and 0.09 for M. alcestes, which were not significantly different. The mixture of yeast autolysate and honey was also found to be a suitable adult diet for production of fertile eggs by C. septempunctata over several generations. \u00a9 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

In the summer, the strips with the fungus were placed using various methods on the bark of pine logs infested with M. alternatus larvae. Approximately 80% on average and a maximum of 100% of the larvae were infected and killed with the fungus using this method. Differences in mortalities between application methods of strips were not clear. This method was also effective for branches infested with M. alternatus larvae. As an application method for B. bassiana to control M. alternatus larvae, the utilization of nonwoven fabric strips impregnated with the fungus was found to be more effective than ordinal spraying and more practical than the implantation of wheat-bran pellets containing the fungus which was developed previously by the authors. \u00a9 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

The daily sampling range in the paddy field was estimated by trap interaction experiments to be more than 100 m in radius for the overwintered generation and ca. 50 m in radius for the first one. Also, the mean flight distance of marked male moths during one night was significantly longer in the overwintered generation (112.0 m) than in the first (18.8 m). \u00a9 1994, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

The gut extract of the weevil contained an active complex of acid carbohydrases and alkaline proteases. Enzymic activities were generally higher in the larva than in the adult. Considerable enzymatic activities were detected in the anterior and posterior midguts. Both trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes were detected in the gut extracts as determined by use of synthetic substrates but the most prevalent protease activity was tryptic. Kola nut extracts of Cola nitida (Vent.) Schott and Endlicher and C. acuminata (Pal De Beauv) Schott and Endlicher inhibited the proteolytic activity in the kola nut weevil but a higher degree of inhibition was recorded for C. acuminata compared with C. nitida at the various extract concentrations tested. Resistance of some kola nut species to weevil attack is ascribed to higher levels of tryptic inhibitors and other intrinsic factors. \u00a9 1994, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

The compound was detected from both sexes of adults as a major component by gas liquid chromatography (GLC), while it occurred as a minor component in the nymphal stages. Its contents were estimated to be 14.2 \u00b13.1 ng per female, 2.9 \u00b1 0.6 ng per male and 0.066 \u00b1 0.01 ng per nymph, respectively. Sexually excited behavior of males was demonstrated by exposing them to a 1\u201310 ng dose of C11whereas escaping behavior was provoked upon exposure to a 100 ng dose. We concluded that the male's quick response towards a female was attributed to sexual differences of C11Content. \u00a9 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved."

The Michaelis constant and maximal velocity, read from the double reciprocal plot which was determined with 1-naphthyl acetate at 40\u00b0C for 10 min, were 1.0\u00d71-3 M and 62.5 nmol/10 min/\u03bcg protein, respectively. Among 13 divalent cations tested, mercury and copper served as potential inhibitors of the enzyme, while cadmium partially inhibited the hydrolytic reaction at higher concentrations. The remaining 10 cations exhibited neither activation nor inhibitory effect at all levels of concentrations tested. Of four subcellular fractions, the 100, 000\u00d7g supernatant fraction (soluble fraction) gave the highest enzyme activity. \u00a9 1994, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

Telenomus triptus and Ooencyrtus nezarae were identified as the parasitoids of P. hybneri eggs. The predominant parasitoid was T. triptus and high parasitism rates were recorded in both years, covering most of the ovipositional period of the P. hybneri that invaded the fields and laid eggs from early July to early August. The parasitism by T. triptus suppressed the hatchability of P. hybneri eggs to very low levels. Activity of this parasitoid accounted for almost all hatching failures. Female adults of T. triptus began to be caught by a sticky suction trap from mid-July in the field. Fewer males were trapped than females with time delay. \u00a9 1993, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved."

Whiteness or luminosity is an essential feature of the visual stimuli and the critical luminosity at which 50% of the experimental females respond falls between N7 and N10 in terms of the Munsell Number. Females responded almost equally (75%) to the models of different sizes ranging from half to quadruple of the normal size and much less (50%) to the models of one fourth. Females responded almost equally to the differently shaped models including butterfly wing shape, rectangle, square, triangle and disk. Movements, or increase and decrease of the stimulative area was found to be another essential feature. The highest percentage of the response was obtained when the models were presented at the revolution rate of 6/s, which is nearly equal to the wing beat frequency of this male butterfly. Low and high critical revolution rates at which 50% of the experimental females responded are ca. 4 and 20-25 per s, respectively. MRP and its key stimuli were discussed in terms of behavioral ecology. \u00a9 1994, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved."

The sensillum contains 2 sensory cells that have unbranched sensory processes growing up to the apical part of the sensory hair. These results are consistent with those of electrophysiological experiments, which show that one of two sensory cells in the basiconic sensilla responds to a natural pheromone and the other responds to a behavioral inhibitor. \u00a9 1993, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, cytotoxic, antifeedant and larvicidal properties of novel quinine isolated from Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa. Methods: A compound was obtained by eluting the crude extract, using varying concentrations of the solvents by the chromatographic purification. Broth micro dilution method was used to assess the antimicrobial activity and anticancer study was evaluated using MTT assay. Larvicidal activity was studied using leaf disc no-choice method. Results: Based on the IR, 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectral data, the compounds were identified as quinone related antibiotic. It exhibited significant activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the compound against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus was 100 and 75 \u03bcg mL-1 respectively. Against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa it exhibited MIC value of 25 \u03bcg mL-1. The MIC of the compound against Aspergillus niger, A. clavatus, Penicillium roqueforti was 20 \u03bcg mL-1 and that against Fusarium oxysporum (20 \u03bcg mL-1), A. oryzae (40 \u03bcg mL-1), and Candida albicans (60 \u03bcg mL-1), respectively. It showed effective antibiofilm activity against E. coli, S. typhii and P. aeroginosa at 8 \u03bcg mL-1 and did not exhibit considerable cytotoxic activity against Vero and HEP2 cell lines. Additionally, the compound documented significant antifeedant and larvicidal activities against Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera litura at 125, 250, 500 and 1000 ppm concentrations. Conclusion: The results concluded that the compound can be evaluated further in industrial applications and also an agent to prepare botanical new pesticide formulations. \u00a9 2014 Rejiniemon et al."

This fly has a significant medical and veterinary importance since it has been reported to transport eggs of Dermatobia hominis (human botfly), which can cause significant economic losses to livestock. Since this screwworm has been collected colonizing both pig carcasses and human cadavers, it is considered one of the most important species for forensic entomology studies. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) gives detailed information on the morphological characteristics which can help identify the immature forms of the flies. The aim of this study was to describe and analyze the morphological characteristics of the eggs, all the larval instars, and the puparia of Cochliomyia macellaria using SEM. The egg is ellipsoid and the dorsal surface is concave. The islands inside the median area had no anastomosis, but some perforations could be observed. From the second larval instar onwards, besides the intersegmental spines, other bands of spines were observed at the abdominal segments. Two spiracular openings were visible on the first and second larval instars, which were not expected. These characteristics are specific to Cochliomyia genus. The number and the general aspect of the spine tips in the cephalic region, the intersegmental bands on the abdomen, and the number of the spiracular openings could together help identify C. macellaria. \u00a9 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Methods: Ovitraps were installed at 44 points in the city, covering six urban areas, from May 2011 to May 2012. After collection, the eggs were incubated until hatching. In the 4th stage of development, the larvae were classified as Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus. Results: In total, 25 633 Aedes spp. eggs were collected. February was the month with the highest incidence, with 5635 eggs collected and a hatching rate of 46.7%. Ae. aegypti eggs had the highest hatching rate, at 72.3%, whereas Ae. albopictus eggs had 27.7%. Climate and population density influenced the number of eggs found. Indicators of vector presence were positively correlated with the occurrence of dengue cases. Conclusion: These data reinforce the need for entomological studies, highlight the relevance of Ae. albopictus as a possible disease vector and demonstrate its adaptation. Ae. albopictus, most commonly found in forested areas, comprised a substantial proportion of the urban mosquito population. \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Department of Zoology, University of Peshawar, Pakistan-Objectives: The importance of X-rays as a diagnostic medical tool cannot be denied. However, continuous exposure to X-rays can cause DNA damage. This study aimed to use the comet assay technique to investigate the level of DNA damage in lymphocytes due to X-rays in occupationally exposed personnel. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 74 exposed and 70 control subjects for analysis. A total of 100 randomly captured cells from each slide were examined using an epifluorescent microscope. The comets were analyzed by a visual scoring method according to comet tail length. Results: The results indicated a significant increase (p<0.05) in DNA damage in X-rays technicians (129.8 \u00b1 17.2) as compared with the control group (53.0 \u00b1 25.0). A significant increase (p<0.02) in DNA damage was also observed with an increase in exposure duration of technicians because of their service length. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the exposed radiology personnel should carefully comply with radiation protection procedures such as wearing of lead apron during diagnostic procedures and minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects due to X-rays."

The production of rifamycin analogue was facilitated by genetic-synthetic strategies that have opened an interdisciplinary route for the development of more such rifamycin analogues aiming at a better therapeutic potential.

The taxa are: families Oreoicidae, Eulacestomatidae, Rhagologidae, Ifritidae and Melampittidae, and subfamilies Pachycareinae, Oreoscopinae, Toxorhamphinae, Oedistomatinae, Peltopsinae and Lamproliinae. The families to which the subfamilies belong are documented. Morphological and behavioural traits of the new family-group taxa are discussed; reasons for taxonomic rankings are summarized; and grounds for the geographic origin of corvoid songbirds, to which all the new families belong, are briefly addressed. One new genus, Megalampitta in Melampittidae, is also described. Copyright \u00a9 2014 Magnolia Press."

A similar self-medication phenomenon was reported in diseased laboratory rodents. In particular, a series of studies revealed that autoimmune MRL/lpr mice readily consume solutions paired or laced with cyclophosphamide (CY), an immunosuppressive drug that prevents inflammatory damage to internal organs. However, due to design limitations, it could not be elucidated whether such a response reflects the learned therapeutic effect of CY, or a deficit in sensory input. We presently assess the behavioural effects of prolonged consumption of CY-laced, 16% sucrose solution in a continuous choice paradigm, with tap water available ad lib. Contrary to overall expectation, MRL/lpr mice did not increase their intake of CY with disease progression. Moreover, they ingested lower doses of CY and preferred less CY-laced sucrose solution than age-matched controls. The results obtained could not confirm zoopharmacognosy in diseased MRL/lpr mice, likely due to impaired responsiveness to palatable stimulation, or attenuated survival mechanisms after prolonged inbreeding in captivity. However, by revealing the effectiveness of unrestricted drinking of drug-laced sucrose solution on behavior and immunity, the current study supports broader use of such an administration route in behavioural studies sensitive to external stressors. \u00a9 2014 Kapadia et al."

This complexity provides the opportunity to evaluate the ecological and social conditions that favor the evolution of complex signaling. We investigated how the chemical signatures of three populations of the social paper wasp Polistes biglumis differed in terms of concentration of hydrocarbons, proportions of branched hydrocarbons and overall variation. We tested whether the variation in chemical signatures among populations could be explained by the prevalence of social parasites or whether this was just an effect of local abiotic conditions which influenced the composition of the hydrocarbon cuticular layer. We studied the chemical signature in three populations in which obligate social parasites differed in the selection pressures they imposed on host populations. Within each population, we restricted our analyses to non-parasitized hosts, to avoid potential short-term effects of parasite presence on the host chemical signatures. We found that host colonies in parasitized populations had more diverse profiles than the parasite-free population. Moreover, the overall concentration of hydrocarbons and the relative proportion of branched hydrocarbons were larger in the parasitized populations, relative to the non-parasitized one. This is to our knowledge the first evidence in favour of the hypothesis that different traits in the host chemical signatures as a whole undergo evolutionary changes resulting from directional or balancing selection imposed by social parasites. We conclude that obligate social parasites act as 'engines of diversity' on host chemical signatures and operate in favor of a geographic mosaic of diverging communication codes. \u00a9 2014 Current Zoology."

General patterns, such as body size trends, have been described regularly. However, most island mammal species are unique and each of them is adapted to a specific local niche as part of an equally specific ecological assemblage. Therefore, comparing island species across taxa, islands and time is inherently dangerous without understanding the adaptational value of the studied feature in the compared taxa and without taking the ecological setting of the taxa into account. In this contribution, general and recurring patterns are described per taxon. Some features, like body mass change and sturdy limbs, are relatively general, whereas most features, like bone fusions and change of orbital axis, occur only in a very few taxa. Some features are even contradictory, such as brain size and degree of hypsodonty, with each taxon having its own particular design. In conclusion, general patterns are more often than not just trends and need to be applied with caution. \u00a9 2013 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology."

This may function either through the overt response of the receiver or through the lack of response of the receiver. Reviewing selected examples, I discuss some of the difficulties in ascribing a model for the mimic. I also discuss how a single animal can have multiple ploys in its armoury of deceptive signals, thus belonging within two or more categories of deceptive signalling. In addition to aggressive mimicry, these may include crypsis or camouflage, masquerade (mimicry of inanimate objects), and Batesian or protective mimicry. Each of these examples of deception has multiple evolutionary pathways, and some deceptive signals may be more costly to receivers than others, but no single organism is subject to a single selection pressure, leading to the reality that many evolutionary pathways contribute to the diversity we see around us. New technologies are opening new channels of investigation into deceptive signaling in many different sensory modalities, and this is reflected in the recent increase in studies investigating the structure and function of deceptive signals. In turn, these studies are beginning to expose the fascinating complexity of deceptive signaling systems, allowing us to discover the myriad, non-mutually exclusive, solutions that can be selected for to obtain prey. \u00a9 2014 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Background: In a large cluster randomized control trial of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) in Western Myanmar the malaria protective effect of ITN was found to be highly variable and, in aggregate, the effect was not statistically significant. A coincident entomological investigation measured malaria vector abundance and biting behaviour and the human population sleeping habits, factors relevant to ITN effectiveness. Methods. Entomological surveys were carried out using different catching methods to identify potential malaria vector species and characterise their biting habits. The salivary glands were dissected from all female anophelines caught to identify sporozoites by microscopy. Findings. Between 1995 and 2000 a total of 4,824 female anopheline mosquitoes were caught with various catching methods. A total of 916 person nights yielded 3,009 female anopheline mosquitoes between 6 pm and 6 am. Except for Anopheles annularis, which showed no apparent preference (51% outdoor biting), all major species showed a strong preference for outdoor biting; Anopheles epiroticus (79%), Anopheles subpictus (72%), Anopheles maculatus (92%), Anopheles aconitus (85%) and Anopheles vagus (72%). Most human biting occurred in the early evening with the peak biting time between 6 pm and 7 pm (35%). Overall 51% (1447/2837) of all bites recorded were between 6 pm and 8 pm. A large proportion of children were not sleeping under an ITN during peak biting times. Only one An. annularis mosquito (0.02%) had malaria sporozoites identified in the salivary glands. Conclusions: Peak vector biting occurred early in the evening and mainly occurred outdoors. The limited efficacy of ITN in this area of Western Myanmar may be explained by the biting behaviour of the prevalent Anopheles mosquito vectors in this area. \u00a9 2013 Smithuis et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "Given current extinction trends, the number of species requiring conservation breeding programs (CBPs) is likely to increase dramatically. To inform CBP policies for threatened terrestrial vertebrates, we evaluated the number and representation of threatened vertebrate species on the IUCN Red List held in the ISIS zoo network and estimated the complexity of their management as metapopulations. Our results show that 695 of the 3,955 (23%) terrestrial vertebrate species in ISIS zoos are threatened. Only two of the 59 taxonomic orders show a higher proportion of threatened species in ISIS zoos than would be expected if species were selected at random. In addition, for most taxa, the management of a zoo metapopulation of more than 250 individuals will require the coordination of a cluster of 11 to 24 ISIS zoos within a radius of 2,000 km. Thus, in the zoo network, the representation of species that may require CBPs is currently low and the spatial distribution of these zoo populations makes management difficult. Although the zoo community may have the will and the logistical potential to contribute to conservation actions, including CBPs, to do so will require greater collaboration between zoos and other institutions, alongside the development of international agreements that facilitate cross-border movement of zoo animals. To maximize the effectiveness of integrated conservation actions that include CBPs, it is fundamental that the non-zoo conservation community acknowledges and integrates the expertise and facilities of zoos where it can be helpful. \u00a9 2013 Conde et al."

Wild cherry fruits were collected in the suburbs of Tokyo, and drosophilid pupae obtained from these fruits were examined for parasitism. Drosophila suzukii was the only drosophilid species infesting fresh wild cherry fruits, and Ganaspis individuals were the major parasitoids attacking D. suzukii in wild cherry fruits. In parasitism experiments, these Ganaspis individuals parasitized D. suzukii larvae in fresh cherry fruits, but did not parasitize those in Drosophila medium. In addition, they did not parasitize larvae of some other fruit-feeding Drosophila species even when these occurred in fresh cherry fruit. These Ganaspis individuals parasitizing D. suzukii were different from those parasitizing D. lutescens and some other drosophilids in nucleotide sequences of the COI gene, as well as in ITS1 and ITS2. They were also different in forewing and antenna morphology, although they showed some overlap in morphological traits. They are tentatively assigned as the suzukii- and lutescens-associated types of G. xanthopoda Ashmead. In the present field survey, Leptopilina japonica Novkovi\u0107 & Kimura and some Asobara species were also observed to attack D. suzukii larvae in wild cherry fruit. \u00a9 2013 The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology."

            "text": "Although biologists and veterinarians have shown considerable success in working together to address wildlife-related issues, including disease, chemical immobilization, reproductive biology, and conservation biology, examples of shared efforts to evaluate and ensure the welfare of study animals are mostly absent. I present the case that this deficiency arises primarily from a lack of mutual understanding between fields with respect to the other's training and experience in addressing animal welfare issues. In effect, each assumes that the final word on animal welfare rests with the other. The reality is, however, that neither field contains the knowledge and skills required to address animal welfare concerns alone. Nevertheless, wildlife researchers are increasingly encountering difficulties conducting research on wild animals because of opposition from stakeholders on the basis of animal welfare concerns. Further, a growing number of articles in the peer-reviewed scientific literature are reporting on potential biases in research results developing from the welfare impacts of widely used techniques, including methods of capturing and marking wildlife. By viewing animal welfare as a shared responsibility and combining their knowledge and skills, wildlife biologists and veterinarians have an opportunity to reform \"invasive\" wildlife research in a manner that is less harmful to the animals being studied, less likely to bias research results, and less objectionable to the stakeholders who ultimately influence or make decisions on how wildlife research is conducted. \u00a9 The Author 2013."

Torrey earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in zoology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1895 and 1898\u00a0respectively, a Ph.D. in zoology from Columbia University in 1903, and an M.D. from the Medical College of Cornell\u00a0University in 1927. He began his academic career as a marine biologist, investigating taxonomy, reproduction,\u00a0morphology, development, regeneration, and behaviour of cnidarians of the west coast of the United States, but his\u00a0research interests soon shifted to experimental biology and endocrinology. He eventually entered the field of medicine,\u00a0specializing in public health, and served as a physician and hospital administrator. Torrey held academic positions at the\u00a0University of California, Berkeley (1895-1912), the Marine Biological Association of San Diego (1903-1912), Reed\u00a0College (1912-1920), the University of Oregon (1920-1926), and Stanford University (1928-1938). Following retirement\u00a0from academia, he served as Director of the Children's Hospital of the East Bay, Oakland, California, from 1938 to 1942.\u00a0In retirement, he continued an association with the University of California at Berkeley, near his home. Of 84 publications\u00a0by him listed herein, 31 dealt with coelenterates. This paper focuses on his early research on coelenterate biology, and\u00a0especially his contributions to taxonomy of hydroids. He was author or coauthor of six genera and 48 species-group taxa\u00a0of Cnidaria, and he also described one new species each of Ctenophora and Phoronida. Although he abandoned systematic\u00a0work early in his career, his most widely cited publication is a taxonomic monograph on hydroids of the west coast of\u00a0North America, published in 1902. He died, at age 97, on 9 September 1970."

Entomological factors involved in malaria transmission in periurban Lusaka were assessed prior to vector control reintroduction. Data was collected through standard entomological and epidemiological protocols and a pretested structured questionnaire. Larval habitats were characterized as transient (43), semipermanent (36), and permanent (21). Anopheles arabiensis and An. gambiae ss. were the only vectors identified. A shift in vector population was noted, with the later outnumbering the former. Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection rates were 25.6 (95 CI: 20.930.7) (n = 297). Parasitaemia was 31.8 (95 CI: 23.242.2), 25.7 (95 CI: 13.541.3), and 23.3 (95 CI: 17.429.6) in under 5, 5 to 14, and above 15 age groups, respectively. Low knowledge levels on vector control tools with an average of 7 residents per household were also observed. This study confirmed a local malaria transmission paradigm. The epidemiology necessitated deployment of an integrated vector management strategy with intensified information education and communication. \u00a9 2012 Emmanuel Chanda et al."

In this study, the effectiveness of three methods for sampling syrphids (Diptera: Syrphidae) in tropical forests is compared: Malaise trapping, collecting adults with an entomological net, and collecting and rearing immatures. Surveys were made from 2008 to 2011 in six tropical forest sites in Costa Rica. The results revealed significant differences in the composition and richness of syrphid faunas obtained by each method. Collecting immatures was the most successful method based on numbers of species and individuals, whereas Malaise trapping was the least effective. This pattern of sampling effectiveness was independent of syrphid trophic or functional group and annual season. An advantage of collecting immatures over collecting adults is the quality and quantity of associated biological data obtained by the former method. However, complementarity between results of collecting adults and collecting immatures, showed that a combined sampling regime obtained the most complete inventory. Differences between these results and similar studies in more open Mediterranean habitats, suggest that for effective inventory, it is important to consider the effects of environmental characteristics on the catchability of syrphids as much as the costs and benefits of different sampling techniques. \u00a9 2012 Entomological Society of America."

It was there that Martin Lister first made the acquaintance of John Ray in 1665. Twenty years later, in London, they cooperated in the production of the ambitious and lavishly illustrated Historia Piscium based on the notes of the late Francis Willughby. Ray, Lister and others contributed additional material. In their own work on fishes, cetaceans and shellfish Ray and Lister were considerably indebted to the Libri de piscibus marinis of an earlier Montpellier professor, Guillaume Rondelet, whose Aristotelian/Galenic approach to the study of medicine and living things was distinguished by a quite exceptional level of knowledge about aquatic species, based on a secure grasp of the classical and contemporary literature, but above all on his own observations in rivers, lakes, lagoons and the open sea, and his domestication (and dissection) of marine species in ponds and aquaria at his country house. Rondelet's book proved useful to Ray and to Lister as a work of reference, as a stimulus for reflection on biological problems, as an aid to nomenclature, as a source of precise descriptions of species, in both words and pictures, as a model to be improved upon in taxonomy, as a warning against reliance on hearsay, and as a valuable account of observations and experiments. Ray used it in much the same way as he used the work of those sixteenthcentury botanists who met with his approval. Several of these had been Rondelet's pupils. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society."

            "text": "Snakes often have specialized diets that undergo a shift from one prey type to another depending on the life stage of the snake. Crotalus viridis viridis (prairie rattlesnake) takes different prey at different life stages, and neonates typically prey on ectotherms, while adults feed almost entirely on small endotherms. We hypothesized that elevated rates of tongue flicking to chemical stimuli should correlate with particular prey consumed, and that this response shifts from one prey type to another as individuals age. To examine if an ontogenetic shift in response to chemical cues occurred, we recorded the rate of tongue flicking for 25 neonate, 20 subadult, and 20 adult (average SVL = 280.9, 552, 789.5 mm, respectively) wild-caught C. v. viridis to chemical stimuli presented on a cotton-tipped applicator; water-soluble cues from two ectotherms (prairie lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, and house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus), two endotherms (deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus and lab mouse, Mus musculus), and water controls were used. Neonates tongue flicked significantly more to chemical cues of their common prey, S. undulatus, than to all other chemical cues; however, the response to this lizard's chemical cues decreased in adult rattlesnakes. Subadults tongue flicked with a higher rate of tongue flicking to both S. undulatus and P. maniculatus than to all other treatments, and adults tongue flicked significantly more to P. maniculatus than to all other chemical cues. In addition, all three sub-classes demonstrated a greater response for natural prey chemical cues over chemical stimuli of prey not encountered in the wild (M musculus and H. frenatus). This shift in chemosensory response correlated with the previously described ontogenetic shifts in C. v. viridis diet. Because many vipers show a similar ontogenetic shift in diet and venom composition, we suggest that this shift in prey cue discrimination is likely a general phenomenon among viperid snakes. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

Embryo size metrics were quantified in 9 field populations across a range of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In the laboratory, first generation (F1) broods of low-DO origin were reared under high or low DO. Brooding period was quantified for the mothers; and egg size, egg metabolic rate and juvenile size-at-release were quantified in their (F2) offspring. The F2 offspring were split and grown for 3 months post-release under high or low DO, and juvenile size and survival were quantified. In the field survey, across stages, embryos from low-DO field populations were shorter and weighed less than embryos from high-DO populations. In the laboratory experiment, F2 eggs and juveniles-at-release from mother's mouth did not differ in mass, length, survival regardless of development DO environment. However, juveniles diverged in size after leaving mother's mouth, exhibiting smaller size when grown under low DO. Size differences in embryo size across field populations and divergence in embryo size after release from the mother's mouth support predictions for smaller body size under hypoxia. There was no evidence for negative effects on survival of juveniles after 3 months. Brooding period was 16% shorter in females reared under low DO suggesting that hypoxia may accelerate embryo development. This work provides insights into how bearer fishes respond to hypoxic stress relative to fishes with no post-spawning parental care; a shorter brooding interval and smaller body size may provide an optimal solution to parent and embryo survival under hypoxia in brooding fishes. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

Despite the profound implications, matching habitat choice has not been unequivocally demonstrated. We conducted two experiments to examine the impact of pigmentation pattern in the color polymorphic pygmy grasshopper Tetrix subulata on habitat choice in a laboratory thermal mosaic arena. We found no behavioral differences in the thermal mosaic among pygmy grasshoppers belonging to either pale, intermediate or dark natural color morphs. However, after manipulating the grasshoppers' phenotype, the utilization through time of warmer and colder parts of the arena was different for black-painted and white-painted individuals. White-painted individuals used warmer parts of the arena, at least during the initial stage of the experiment. We conclude that microhabitat choice represents a form of behavioural plasticity. Thus, even if the choice itself is flexible and not genetically determined, it can still lead to spatial genetic structure in the population because the phenotypes themselves may be genetically mediated. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

This complex social behavior is influenced by genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. In many organisms, aggression is critical to survival, but the ability to control and suppress aggression in distinct contexts also is necessary. Invertebrate organisms, with their relatively simple nervous systems and a multiplicity of powerful tools available to examine their often elaborate and complex behavioral displays, have become increasingly valuable models for investigating the genetic and systems biological roots of social behavior. In this protocol, we outline methods for analyzing aggression in Drosophila: The design encompasses eco-ethological constraints that emphasize an understanding of normal aggression. The details include steps for constructing a fight arena, isolating and painting flies, introducing flies to an arena, and videotaping and scoring fights. These experimental protocols are in current use to identify candidate genes important in aggression and to elaborate the neuronal circuitry underlying the display of aggression and other social behaviors. \u00a9 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

In order to identify the key ingredients of the emergence of Laughlin physics in these systems, we show how they are affected when tuning the band structure. We also address the question of the relevance of the Berry curvature flatness in this problem. Using three-body interactions, we show that some models can also host a topological phase reminiscent of the \u03bd=1/2 Pfaffian Moore-Read state.

Unfortunately, our understanding of population dynamics has historically been based on an assumption that individuals are identical with homogenous life-history properties. This assumption is certainly false for most natural systems, raising the question of what role individual variation plays in the dynamics of populations. While there has been an increase of interest regarding the effects of within population variation on the dynamics of single populations, there has been little study of the effects of differences in within population variation on patterns observed across populations. We found that life-history differences (clutch size) among individuals explained the majority of the variation observed in the degree to which population sizes of eastern fence lizards Sceloporus undulatus fluctuated. This finding suggests that differences across populations cannot be understood without an examination of differences at the level of a system rather than at the level of the individual. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

We conducted laboratory studies to (1) determine if urea can function as a disturbance cue in juvenile convict cichlids and rainbow trout and (2) determine if the background level of urea influences the behavioral response to a subsequent pulse of urea ('background noise' hypothesis). In the first series of trials, juvenile cichlids and trout were exposed to urea at varying concentrations (0 to 0.5 mg L-1 for cichlids and 0 to 1.0 mg L-1 for trout). Our results suggest that both cichilds and trout exhibited functionally similar responses to urea and conspecific disturbance cues and that increasing the concentration of urea results in an increase intensity of antipredator behaviour. In the second series of trials, we pre-exposed cichlids or trout to intermediate or high concentrations of urea (or a distilled water control) and then tested for the response to a second pulse of urea at at intermediate or high concentrations (versus a distilled water control). Our results demonstrate that pre-exposure to urea reduces or eliminates the response to a second pulse of urea, supporting the background noise hypothesis. Together, our results suggest that pulses of urea, released by disturbed or stressed individuals, may function as an early warning signal in freshwater prey species. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

Reproduction in the colony is restricted usually to a single female. Complete colonies captured throughout an entire calendar year were euthanased and the histology of the gonads and plasma hormone concentrations were measured in reproductive and non-reproductive members of both sexes. In males, the circulating levels of testosterone were significantly higher in the reproductive male than the non-reproductive males. The mean testes mass for the reproductive males corrected for body mass was not significantly greater than that of the non-reproductive male. Similarly, the mean testes volume of reproductive males was not greater than that for the non-reproductive males but the seminiferous tubule diameter was significantly greater in the reproductive males than the non-reproductive males. Reproductive females characteristically possessed corpora lutea of ovulation and pregnancy in their ovaries and this was met with much higher progesterone concentrations in the reproductive females 34nmol/L compared with 4nmols/L in the non-reproductive females. In contrast, non-reproductive females showed a complete range of follicular genesis, but they did not possess corpora lutea of ovulation or pregnancy, in turn they show depressed progesterone concentrations. The current evidence suggests that in Ansell's mole-rats, the non-reproductive males and females refrain from sexual activity by being subordinate and moreover, related to the breeding pair. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

Increasing connectivity between European large rivers facilitates invasion by drifting aquatic macroinvertebrates. The present study shows that high abundances of invasive species drift in the headstream of the river Rhine. Dikerogammarus villosus and Chelicorophium curvispinum represented up to 90% of the total of drifting macroinvertebrates. Drift activity shows seasonal and diel patterns. Most species started drifting in spring and were most abundant in the water column during the summer period. Drift activity was very low during the winter period. Diel patterns were apparent; most species, including D. villosus, drifted during the night. Drifting macroinvertebrates colonised stony substrate directly from the water column. D. villosus generally colonised the substrate at night, while higher numbers of C. curvispinum colonised the substrate during the day. It is very likely that drifting functions as a dispersal mechanism for crustacean invaders. Once waterways are connected, these species are no longer necessarily dependent on dispersal vectors other than drift for extending their distribution range. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

However, the passage of spores through the digestive tract of vertebrates can affect the activity and viability of the spores ingested. This phenomenon has been rarely documented in opportunistic mycophagists consuming epigeous fungi. Using laboratory experiments, we investigated the activity and viability of spores of two epigeous ectomycorrhizal fungal species (Laccaria trichodermophora and Suillus tomentosus) after passage through the digestive tract of two opportunistic mycophagous small rodents, the volcano mouse Peromyscus alstoni and the deer mouse P. maniculatus. We found that passage through the gut of either species of rodent had a significant effect on spore activity and viability for both fungal species. The proportion of active spores (0.37-0.40) of L. trichodermophora in the feces of both species of rodents was less than that recorded for the control (0.82). However, the proportion of active spores (0.64-0.73) of S. tomentosus in the feces of each species of rodent was higher than in the control (0.40). On the other hand, the viability of spores was lower (0.26-0.30 in L. trichodermophora and 0.60-0.69 in S. tomentosus) for both fungi when consumed by either rodent relative to the controls (0.90 in L. trichodermophora and 0.82 in S. tomentosus). These findings suggest that these rodent species may be effective dispersers of both epigeous fungi. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

Such environmental cycles are often linked to the timing of reproduction. Here, using the circulating androgen concentrations, gonadal investment patterns and detailed behavioral observations we show that wild populations of the group-living cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher from Lake Tanganyika, have marked diurnal differences in behavior and lunar synchronicity in their reproductive physiology and behavior. Female ovarian investment peaked in the first quarter of the lunar cycle. In males, plasma steroid hormone levels and sperm swimming speed were highest at this same lunar stage, supporting the idea that egg laying occurs during this phase and that young will emerge at full moon, perhaps because nocturnal predators can be best detected then. Female subordinate group members' gonadal investment patterns mirrored the lunar pattern observed in dominant female breeders. In contrast, male subordinates did not show a change in gonadal investment or in steroid hormone concentrations across the lunar cycle, suggesting that female subordinates, but not male subordinates, reproduce within the social group. Neolamprologus pulcher demonstrated diurnal cycles in behavior, with higher rates of feeding in the morning. Male and female breeding pairs were strongly size matched potentially as a result of size-assortative mating; also the gonadal investment of male and female mated pairs was strongly correlated indicating within-pair reproductive synchronicity. In general, this study provides evidence for the impact of environmental cues (sunlight and moonlight) on circulating hormones and reproduction in a small tropical freshwater fish. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

            "text": "Cryptic behavior and unpalatability are common defensive strategies that occur in different taxonomic groups, but the effectiveness of these defensive strategies is context dependent, varying with predator type and co-occurring species. We tested this assumption by measuring the mortality rates of Eupemphix nattereri (cryptic behavior) and Rhinella schneideri (unpalatable) tadpoles in association with the predatory fish Oreochromis niloticus (vertebrate) and the dragonfly larvae of Aeshna sp. (invertebrate). We designed a second experiment to evaluate whether fish predators are capable of learning to avoid unpalatable prey once they have encountered it. Our results showed that fish preyed selectively on palatable tadpoles, avoiding unpalatable tadpoles and that the odonate larvae were more efficient in preying on the more active unpalatable tadpoles and less efficient in capturing those tadpoles that presented cryptic behaviors. Additionally, our data suggest that the antipredator traits of tadpoles can interact with each other, with cryptic tadpoles showing lesser mortality when co-occurring with unpalatable tadpoles and odonate predators. Unpalatable tadpoles also increase the mortality of cryptic tadpoles in the presence of experienced fish predators. These prey traits interact in modifying the prey preference of the predator, which constitutes a prey-induced trait-mediated interaction (TMI). This type of TMI is dependent on the system complexity (number of predator and prey species interactions) and could define food web properties, such as the role of predators and the number of competitor species in the system. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

Secondary factors that helped the control such as rural exodus are also analyzed. The article shows that since 1965 the control became a campaign with different phases due to the epidemiological situation, the acquired knowledge and the entomological surveillance. After 25 years of work, the elimination of all the focus of Triatoma infestans was finally reached and the campaign was ended. However, due to the possibility of reintroduction of the vector in rural areas by passive transportation besides the presence of secondary vectors (Triatoma sordida and Panstrongylus megistus) in several localities, the vector control activities were not interrupted and the surveillance is continuous."

The first publication examined the DVS from the Americas, with the second covering those species present in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Here we discuss the 19 DVS of the Asian-Pacific region. This region experiences a high diversity of vector species, many occurring sympatrically, which, combined with the occurrence of a high number of species complexes and suspected species complexes, and behavioural plasticity of many of these major vectors, adds a level of entomological complexity not comparable elsewhere globally. To try and untangle the intricacy of the vectors of this region and to increase the effectiveness of vector control interventions, an understanding of the contemporary distribution of each species, combined with a synthesis of the current knowledge of their behaviour and ecology is needed. Results: Expert opinion (EO) range maps, created with the most up-to-date expert knowledge of each DVS distribution, were combined with a contemporary database of occurrence data and a suite of open access, environmental and climatic variables. Using the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) modelling method, distribution maps of each DVS were produced. The occurrence data were abstracted from the formal, published literature, plus other relevant sources, resulting in the collation of DVS occurrence at 10116 locations across 31 countries, of which 8853 were successfully geo-referenced and 7430 were resolved to spatial areas that could be included in the BRT model. A detailed summary of the information on the bionomics of each species and species complex is also presented. Conclusions: This article concludes a project aimed to establish the contemporary global distribution of the DVS of malaria. The three articles produced are intended as a detailed reference for scientists continuing research into the aspects of taxonomy, biology and ecology relevant to species-specific vector control. This research is particularly relevant to help unravel the complicated taxonomic status, ecology and epidemiology of the vectors of the Asia-Pacific region. All the occurrence data, predictive maps and EO-shape files generated during the production of these publications will be made available in the public domain. We hope that this will encourage data sharing to improve future iterations of the distribution maps. \u00a9 2011 Sinka et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "The only way for dengue to spread in the human population is through the human-mosquito-human cycle. Most research in this field discusses the dengue-mosquito or dengue-human relationships over a particular study area, but few have explored the local spatial variations of dengue-mosquito and dengue-human relationships within a study area. This study examined whether spatial heterogeneity exists in these relationships. We used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to analyze spatial relationships and identify the geographical heterogeneities by using the information of entomology and dengue cases in the cities of Kaohsiung and Fengshan in 2002. Our findings indicate that dengue-mosquito and dengue-human relationships were significantly spatially non-stationary. This means that in some areas higher dengue incidences were associated with higher vector/host densities, but in some areas higher incidences were related to lower vector/host densities. We demonstrated that a GWR model can be used to geographically differentiate the relationships of dengue incidence with immature mosquito and human densities. This study provides more insights into spatial targeting of intervention and control programs against dengue outbreaks within the study areas. \u00a9 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI."

In this contribution, a large number of specimens of Ophiomusium acuferum Lyman, 1869 and Ophiomisidium pulchellum (Wyville Thomson, 1878) were sampled from southeastern and southern Brazilian at depths ranging from 46 to 1300 m. A close analysis has shown that specimens identified as Ophiomisidium pulchellum (C.W. Thomson, 1877) in several Brazilian museums are actually Ophiomusium acuferum Lyman, 1875. A total of 2330 individuals were examined: 2046 specimens of Ophiomusium acuferum ('Evaluation of the sustainable potential of living resources from the Brazilian Economic Exclusive Zone/Score South - Benthos' - REVIZEE; 'Rational usage of coastal ecosystems from the Brazilian Tropical Region: S\u00e3o Paulo State - Integrated Project/Subproject Benthos' - INTEGRADO; and the MD55/ Brazil) and 284 of Ophiomisidium pulchellum (MD55/Brazil). The disc diameter of each individual was measured and the specimens were digitally photographed. The samples studied are deposited in the Museum of Zoology of the University of Campinas and Institute of Biology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The specimens from the MD55 are deposited at the Paris Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle. An identification key to these species is provided here. A detailed morphological analysis and redescription of both species, comparisons, and their geographic distribution in Brazil are discussed. \u00a9 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

            "text": "In August 2008, a team from the National Environmental Agency conducted an entomological investigation of a chikungunya cluster in Singapore, with the primary aim of identifying the vector responsible for the outbreak and to assess the vector control operation. A total of 173 adult mosquitoes were caught using both the sweep-net method and the BG Sentinel Traps in and around the affected workers' quarters. Of these, 120 (69.4%) were Aedes albopictus and the rest were Culex quinquefasciatus. More than 2700 Ae. albopictus larvae were also collected from 33 breeding habitats detected. No Aedes aegypti was found. During the preintervention period, 6 (8.4%) out of 71 adult female Ae. albopictus were found positive for the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Vector control measures resulted in a 90% reduction of adult Ae. albopictus caught by BG Sentinel Traps. Postintervention surveillance revealed the presence of CHIKV-positive mosquitoes. These findings led to continued intensive vector control operation in the affected area that further reduced vector population and interrupted the transmission of the disease. The E1 gene sequence of the CHIKV was identical to those of CHIKV isolated from human chikungunya cases working in the affected area, and contained the A226V mutation. The incrimination of Ae. albopictus as a major vector involved in the transmission of A226V CHIKV had led to the revision of chikungunya control strategy in Singapore. This study suggests the benefit of a vector control program that includes the evaluation of control measures in conjunction to virological surveillance in vector population. \u00a9 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Linking these two together is based almost exclusively on the Phoenix supposedly coming from Arabia. However, a detailed analysis of the sources clearly shows that the two myths are essentially different, and describe two birds that are completely divergent in shape, mythical development and textual significance. Although the 'Anq\u0101' has merged in some texts with the myth of the Phoenix, because of its long life, Arab and Persian literature also speak of a bird known as 'Anq\u0101' which has essentially the same characteristics as the one in the Greco-Latin myth of the Phoenix. The qaqnus bird, in addition, is usually mentioned as another bird along with the 'Anq\u0101', making clear that it is different and separate from this."

In environments where signal transmission is highly variable, signalers may utilize complex signals, which incorporate multiple components and modalities, to maintain effective communication. Male Rabidosa rabida wolf spiders produce complex courtship signals, consisting of both visual and seismic components. We test the hypothesis that the complex signaling of R. rabida contributes to male reproductive success in variable signaling environments. We first examine the condition-dependence of foreleg ornamentation (a presumed visual signal) and seismic signal components and find that both may provide potentially redundant information on foraging history. Next, we assessed reproductive success across manipulated signaling environments that varied in the effectiveness of visual and/or seismic signal transmission. In environments where only one signal could be successfully transmitted (e.g., visual or seismic), pairs were still able to successfully copulate. Additionally, we found that males altered their courtship display depending on the current signaling environment. Specifically, males reduced their use of a visual display component in signaling environments where visual signal transmission was ablated. Incorporating signals in multiple modalities not only enables R. rabida males to maintain copulation success across variable signaling environments, but it also enables males to adjust their composite courtship display to current signaling conditions. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

Using regression approaches we search for a model that is a good morphological predictor of these bite forces. Body mass, an index that ignores differences in skull morphology, has a statistically significant relationship with bite force (R2=0.76) but is a relatively poor predictor compared with our best model (R2=0.94). The two best models of the eight we examine are one based on an estimate of strength of dentary, which is really simple beam theory; and the other based on muscle mass and jaw mechanics of input and output arms. Both models explain about 90% of the variation in bite force. However, the combination of these variables together in multiple regression works even better, explaining about 94% of the variation. Our model derived from beam theory relies on bony characteristics, which are readily available from museum specimens. This model will be of particular use to students of fossils or ecomorphology for inferring bite force. We also test Freeman's earlier predictions about bite forces of bats with gracile versus robust skulls. These predictions can be only partially confirmed. For species we measured, bats with gracile skulls did have weak bites; however, bats designated by Freeman as having robust skulls did not have particularly strong bites. \u00a9 2010 The Authors.

We have catalogued the bats deposited in the Biology Museum Prof. Mello Leit\u00e3o (MBML), Laboratory of Bat Studies of the Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo (LABEQ), Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ), Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), and University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ). In addition, we have investigated the literature seeking articles about bats exclusively for the State. About bats were published in the state 42 papers, three thesis and 11 monographs. There are recognized 63 bat species in the State, if considering the museum collections and published papers, from 37 of the 78 municipalities of Esp\u00edrito Santo. The highest species richness was found in the municipalities of Linhares and Santa Teresa. This was probably occasioned by bias on sampling. The great potential for new bat occurrences in Esp\u00edrito Santo is due to the lack of knowledge about bats in this State. This emphasizes the importance for new future studies about bats in that area."

Chandra's exquisite resolution has also unveiled entirely new populations of faint sources and transients, as well as regions of extreme gas dynamics and hints of prior, more typical AGN-like activity in our Galactic Center."

Line-transect sampling and total count methods were used to gather data on demographics and movement patterns. The population's age-group composition was 58% adults, 25% sub-adults, 9% juveniles, 5% calves and 3% unidentified with a female-male sex ratio of 2:1. Population density was found to be significantly different between the two sub-populations (Dinsho Sanctuary and Gaysay/Adelay). A significant difference was found for age-group composition across the two sub-populations except adult females, sub-adult males and calves. The Dinsho sub-population was an isolated group. Separation and containment of the mountain nyala population could have negatively affected their ability to search for habitat requirements and mates from distant areas. The population varied between 830-908 individuals (95% CI), a reduction of 45% from earlier reports. However, the mean population density increased due to contraction of the species' habitat range. We observed a population decrease of 2%-5% per year over the course of our study. Many of the assessed demographic parameters did not significantly change over the three years. This suggests that the decrease in nyala population was not due to random variations in reproduction. Anthropogenic factors such as competition with livestock for forage, habitat encroachment and poaching by the local people might have been partly responsible for the depleted population in our study areas. \u00a9 2010 Current Zoology."

This species is considered threatened. For this reason it is especially relevant to improve knowledge about its natural history, previously unknown. Despite the large size of nymphs, this species shows a univoltine life cycle. The growth is slow but uniform from October to April or May when the short flight period occurs. The analysis of the gut contents indicates this species is a predator, feeding mainly on Baetidae and Chironomidae. It is notable that the development of this carnivorous species through cold periods coincides with the season with higher richness and density of potential prey in Apennine streams. Further studies are needed to improve knowledge of the distribution of the species and to start planning effective conservation efforts. \u00a9 2009 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

            "text": "Background: Several cases of malaria are frequently recorded during the dry period in Ouagadougou town (Burkina Faso). This has led to the design of a series of studies focusing on both parasitological and entomological investigations intended to provide relevant health data on the risk of local malaria transmission according to the way of urbanisation. Methods. A cross-sectional entomological survey was carried out in various districts of Ouagadougou in April and October 2006. Adult malaria vectors were collected using CDC traps and indoor insecticide spraying performed in four houses during four consecutive days/nights. Intensive larval sampling was also done in available water ponds throughout the study sites. Results. In April, the anopheline breeding sites consisted only of semi-permanent or permanent swamps located mainly in the two peripheral districts. Despite the presence of anopheline larvae in these breeding sites, less than five Anopheles gambiae s.l. adults were caught by CDC traps and indoor insecticide spraying. In October, additionally to the permanent breeding sites reported in April, some rainfall swamps were also found positive to anophelines. The number of adults' mosquitoes was higher than that collected in April (2 vs 159 in October). Out of 115 larvae of An. gambiae s.l. analysed by PCR in April, 59.1% (68/115) were identified as Anopheles arabiensis, 39.1% (45/115) as An. gambiae M while the S form represented less than 2%. Overall 120 larvae and 86 females were identified by PCR in October as An. gambiae M form (51%) and An. arabiensis (42.2%). The S form represented only 6.8%. The global sporozoite rate recorded was high (6.8%) and did not differ between the districts except in the central district where no positive mosquito was detected. Conclusion. Although only few adults' mosquitoes were actively caught during the driest month, malaria vectors persisted all year long that increases the risk of urban malaria transmission. The distribution of breeding sites and especially the occurrence of malaria vectors were more abundant in the periphery, which is more like that of a rural settlement. The evolution of malaria prevalence and the factors sustaining the risk of transmission in Ouagadougou as well in many African cities during the dry season are discussed. \u00a9 2010 Fournet et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

IAPAR designed traps [plastic bottles (2 L) lured with methanol:ethanol (1:1) in a vessel] were placed either at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5m high from the ground or simultaneously tested in the 2004 fructifi cation season. Traps placed at the three heights trapped 5.5 times more CBB than the others, mostly at the traps placed at 0.5 m (75%). Treatments using the IAPAR designed trap placed at 1.2 m high; IAPAR trap with a white plastic plate above (IAPAR modifi ed I) at 1.2 m high; IAPAR at 0.5 m high and two additional vessels at 1.0 and 1.5m high (IAPAR modifi ed II) and T-163 trap [three red plastic cups (300 ml) and a red plastic plate as a cover] lured with M:E (1:1) at 1.2m height were compared in the vegetative (2005) and fructifi cation (2006) periods. IAPAR modifi ed II (dispenser vessels placed at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m) trapped more beetles than the remaining types (2.72 times more beetles than IAPAR design); and IAPAR modifi ed I traps trapped more beetles than T 163 and IAPAR traps in the vegetative period. In the reproductive period, IAPAR modifi ed II trapped less beetles than IAPAR and IAPAR modifi ed I. In 2007 vegetative season, IAPAR modifi ed II trap were compared with IAPAR trap and trapped 2.8 times more beetles. The positive responses to a vertical distribution of the volatile attractants in the vegetative period of the planting allow the development of more effi cient trapping systems for CBB."

            "text": "The potential for ornament evolution in response to sexual selection rests on the interaction between the permissiveness or selectivity of female preferences and the constraints on male development of signaling related traits. We investigate the former by determining how latent female preferences either exaggerate the magnitude of current traits (i.e. elaborations) or favor novel traits (i.e. innovations). In t\u00fangara frogs, females prefer complex mating calls (whine-chucks) to simple calls (whine only). The whine is critical for mate recognition while the chuck further enhances the attractiveness of the call. Here we use a combination of synthetic and natural stimuli to examine latent female preferences. Our results show that a diversity of stimuli, including conspecific and heterospecific calls as well as predator-produced and human-made sounds, increase the attractiveness of a call when added to a whine. These stimuli do not make simple calls more attractive than a whine-chuck, however. In rare cases we found stimuli that added to the whine decrease the attractiveness of the call. Overall, females show strong preferences for both elaborations and innovations of the chuck. We argue that the emancipation of these acoustic adornments from mate recognition allows such female permissiveness, and that male constraints on signal evolution are probably more important in explaining why males evolved their specific adornment. Experimentally probing latent female preferences for stimuli out of the species' range is a useful means to gain insights about the potential of female choice to influence signal evolution and thus the astounding diversity in male sexually-selected traits. \u00a9 2010 Current Zoology."

Since World War I, infectious diseases have no longer been the main causes of morbidity and mortality among soldiers. However, most recent conflicts involving Western armies have occurred overseas, increasing the risk of vector-borne disease for the soldiers and for the displaced populations. The threat of vector-borne disease has changed with the progress in hygiene and disease control within the military: some diseases have lost their military significance (e.g. plague, yellow fever, and epidemic typhus); others remain of concern (e.g. malaria and dengue fever); and new potential threats have appeared (e.g. West Nile encephalitis and chikungunya fever). For this reason, vector control and personal protection strategies are always major requirements in ensuring the operational readiness of armed forces. Scientific progress has allowed a reduction in the impact of arthropod-borne diseases on military forces, but the threat is always present, and a failure in the context of vector control or in the application of personal protection measures could allow these diseases to have the same devastating impact on human health and military readiness as they did in the past. \u00a9 2010 The Authors.

This study reports on the epidemiological situation relating to malaria and to the areas that were subjected to human actions (deforestation, human settlement, fish-rearing activity, etc) in Manaus, between 1986 and 2005. In this municipality, the population increase from 1986 to 2005 was 105.2%. This resulted from occupation of space, in the form of invasions and housing projects. From 2003, the increase in relation to 1986 was more than 2,000%. In these areas, there were increases in disease incidence. The annual parasitic index in the municipality ranged from low to medium risk and, between urban zones, it ranged from no risk to high risk. In the eastern, western and northern zones, which still contain areas with agricultural characteristics, there was greater receptivity and vulnerability to transmission."

The events leading up to and the subsequent development of the discipline are discussed. \u00a9 2009 Cambridge University Press."

During the winter (December-March) horseshoe crabs moved very little. In the spring, when water temperatures exceeded 11\u00b0C, horseshoe crabs moved at least 1 km further up into the estuary to shallower subtidal areas about a month prior to spawning. The mean distance traveled during spring migrations was 2.6 \u00b1 0.5 (n=20) km up the estuary. Mating occurred in May and June and during these months animals spent most of their time in shallow subtidal areas adjacent to mating beaches. In the summer (July-August), animals moved 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 (n=26) km down the estuary, towards the ocean, and ranged widely, using extensive portions of the estuary. In the fall (September-November) movement was more limited (0.5 \u00b1 0.5 km; n = 24) while animals settled into wintering locations, where they remained until spring. The mean annual linear range for all animals was 4.5 \u00b1 0.3 km (n =35) and the maximum distance traveled by an individual horseshoe crab within one year was 9.2 km. There was no evidence that any of the horseshoe crabs tracked during this study left the estuary [Current Zoology 56 (5): 587-598, 2010]. \u00a9 2010 Current Zoology."

            "text": "The night sky is the venue of an ancient acoustic battle between echolocating bats and their insect prey. Many tiger moths (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) answer the attack calls of bats with a barrage of high frequency clicks. Some moth species use these clicks for acoustic aposematism and mimicry, and others for sonar jamming, however, most of the work on these defensive functions has been done on individual moth species. We here analyze the diversity of structure in tiger moth sounds from 26 species collected at three locations in North and South America. A principal components analysis of the anti-bat tiger moth sounds reveals that they vary markedly along three axes: (1) frequency, (2) duty cycle (sound production per unit time) and frequency modulation, and (3) modulation cycle (clicks produced during flexion and relaxation of the sound producing tymbal) structure. Tiger moth species appear to cluster into two distinct groups: one with low duty cycle and few clicks per modulation cycle that supports an acoustic aposematism function, and a second with high duty cycle and many clicks per modulation cycle that is consistent with a sonar jamming function. This is the first evidence from a community-level analysis to support multiple functions for tiger moth sounds. We also provide evidence supporting an evolutionary history for the development of these strategies. Furthermore, cross-correlation and spectrogram correlation measurements failed to support a \"phantom echo\" mechanism underlying sonar jamming, and instead point towards echo interference. \u00a9 2010 Current Zoology."

The course is a response to the serious health and socioeconomic burden caused by a number of vector-borne diseases in Pakistan. The persistence, emergence and re-emergence of these diseases is mainly attributed to the scarcity of trained vector-control experts. The training course attempts to fill the gap in trained manpower and thus reduce the morbidity and mortality due to these diseases, resulting in incremental gains to public health. This paper aims to outline the steps taken to establish the course and the perceived challenges to be addressed in order to sustain its future implementation."

Inheritance testing showed a single-gene dominant mutation and lethality in the KitW-1Bao homozygous mice. The mutation was mapped to Chromosome 5 between markers D5Mit356 and D5Mit308. The region contains the Kit gene, whose mutations are known to lead to pigmentation defects in mice. Sequence analysis of the Kit cDNA from KitW-1Bao heterozygotes revealed an A to T missense mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution of Asp (D) by Val (V) at amino acid position 849 within a highly conserved tyrosine kinase domain. The combined phenotype displayed by the KitW-1Bao heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice demonstrates the critical function of the highly conserved aspartic acid residue at position 849 in the Kit gene product. \u00a9 2009 Current Zoology."

Guinea pig stomach strips were mounted under organ baths containing Krebs solution. Motilin, EM-A, N-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), L-arginine (L-AA) were added to the bathing solution in a non-cumulative way. Then the effects of motilin and EM-A was studied during electrical field stimulation (EFS) in the absence and presence of L-NNA and L-AA in the gastric anturm and fundus of guinea pigs. In addition, we observed the co-expression of motilin receptors and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the gastric myenteric plexus of guinea pigs by fluo-immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the circular muscle tissues of the gastric fundus generated on-relaxations and off-contractions with the frequency of 1 -16 Hz. The on-responses induced a relaxation, partially mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) because addition of L-NNA turned the relaxations into cholinergically mediated contractions. The off-contractions were also cholinergically mediated as they disappeared under non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) conditions using atropine and guanethidine. In fundic strips, motilin and EM-A induced on-relaxation and off-contraction and both motilin (1 funol/L) and EM-A (100 funol/D may significantly increased on-response and reduced off-response (P < 0.05). And the effects of motilin on strip responses were significantly enhanced compared with EM-A. The on-responses could be reversed into a cholinergically mediated contraction by addition of NOS inhibitors L-NNA. In contrast, administration of substrate of NOS, L-AA, significantly increased on-relaxations and reduced cholinergic motor responses which were induced by motilin or EM-A. However D-arginine (D-AA) did not change the above response induced by motilin or EM-A. In the antral strips, motilin and EM-A only increased off-contractions. The response to motilin and EM-A in the presence of L-NNA did differ from that obtained with L-NNA alone. It showed that both motilin and EM-A could enhance off-contractions induced by L-NNA (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry study showed that motilin receptor immunoreactive positive neurons were co-localized with nNOS positive neurons in the gastric myenteric plexus of the guinea pigs. These results suggested that motilin or EM-A modulates gastrointestinal motility which was mediated by activating gastric nervous and NO pathways in guinea pigs gastro-intestinal tract. \u00a9 2009 Current Zoology."

Our results revealed the presence of rDNA polymorphism among A. jeffersonianum populations in terms of number, location and FISH signal intensity on the chromosomes. Nine rDNA cytotypes were found in ten geographically isolated populations and most of them contained derivative rDNA sites. Our preliminary study provides strong indication of karyotypic diversification of A. jeffersonianum that is demonstrated by intraspecific variation of 45S rDNA cytotypes. rDNA cytotype polymorphism has been described in many other caudate amphibians. We predict that habitat isolation, low dispersal ability and decline of effective population size could facilitate the fixation and accumulation of variable rDNA cytotypes during their chromosome. \u00a9 2009 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Climate change has advanced the phenology of many organisms. Migratory animals face particular problems because climate change in the breeding and the wintering range may be asynchronous, preventing rapid response to changing conditions. Advancement in timing of spring migration may have carry-over effects to other parts of the annual cycle, simply because advancement of one event in the annual cycle also advances subsequent events, gradually causing a general shift in the timing of the entire annual cycle. Such a phenotypic shift could generate accumulating effects over the years for individuals, but also across generations. Here we test this novel hypothesis of phenotypic response to climate change by using long-term data on the Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea. Mean breeding date advanced by almost three weeks during the last 70 years. Annual arrival date at the breeding grounds during a period of 47 years was predicted by environmental conditions in the winter quarters in the Southern Ocean near the Antarctic and by mean breeding date the previous year. Annual mean breeding date was only marginally determined by timing of arrival the current year, but to a larger extent by arrival date and breeding date the previous year. Learning affected arrival date as shown by a positive correlation between arrival date in year (i + l) relative to breeding date in year(i)and the selective advantage of early breeding in year(i). This provides a mechanism for changes in arrival date being adjusted to changing environmental conditions. This study suggests that adaptation to changing climatic conditions can be achieved through learning from year to year. \u00a9 2009 Current Zoology."

This study explores two methods for making pupal surveys more practical yet reliable and used data from 10 pupal surveys conducted in Puerto Rico during 2004-2008. The number of pupae per person for each sampling followed a negative binomial distribution, thus showing aggregation. One method found a common aggregation parameter (k) for the negative binomial distribution, a finding that enabled the application of a sequential sampling method requiring few samples to determine whether the number of pupae/person was above a vector density threshold for dengue transmission. A second approach used the finding that the mean number of pupae/person is correlated with the proportion of pupa-infested households and calculated equivalent threshold proportions of pupa-positive households. A sequential sampling program was also developed for this method to determine whether observed proportions of infested households were above threshold levels. These methods can be used to validate entomological thresholds for dengue transmission. Copyright \u00a9 2009 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene."

Depending on the simulation outputs, the smoothed distribution pattern of the estimates of I by delete-1 jackknife is visually distinguishable from the normal density, but the smoothed pattern produced by delete-d jackknife, and logarithmtransformed smoothed patterns produced by both empirical and parametric bootstraps, matched well the corresponding normal density. Thus, the estimates of I produced by delete-1 jackknife were not used to determine the suppressive effect of wasps and insecticides. The 95% percent confidence intervals or the narrowest 95 percentiles and Z-test criterion were employed to compare the effectiveness of Trichogramma japonicum Ashmead and insecticides (powder, 1.5% mevinphos + 3% alpha-hexachloro cyclohexane) against the rice leaf roller based on the estimates of I produced by delete-d jackknife and bootstrap techniques. At = 0.05 level, there were statistical differences between wasp treatment and control, and between wasp and insecticide treatments, if the normality is ensured, or by the narrowest 95 percentiles. However, there is still no difference between insecticide treatment and control. By Z-test criterion, wasp treatment is better than control and insecticide treatment with Pvalue < 0.01. Insecticide treatment is similar to control with P-value > 0.2 indicating that 95% confidence intervals procedure is more conservative. Although similar conclusions may be drawn by re-sampling techniques, such as the delta method, about the suppressive effect of trichogramma and insecticides, the normality of the estimates can be checked and guaranteed, and the correlation among sequential life stages of rice leaf roller is also considered in the estimation. Judged by the P-values from Z-test, the delta method is more conservative. \u00a9 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science."

If the surface is replaced by a belt moving with speed U, the rotational symmetry of the buckling instability is broken and a wealth of interesting states are observed. We experimentally studied this \"fluid-mechanical sewing machine\" in a more precise apparatus. As U is reduced, the steady catenary thread bifurcates into a meandering state in which the thread displacements are only transverse to the motion of the belt. We measured the amplitude and frequency \u03c9 of the meandering close to the bifurcation. For smaller U, single-frequency meandering bifurcates to a two-frequency \"figure-8\" state, which contains a significant 2\u03c9 component and parallel as well as transverse displacements. This eventually reverts to single-frequency coiling at still smaller U. More complex, highly hysteretic states with additional frequencies are observed for larger nozzle heights. We propose to understand this zoology in terms of the generic amplitude equations appropriate for resonant interactions between two oscillatory modes with frequencies \u03c9 and 2\u03c9. The form of the amplitude equations captures both the axisymmetry of the U=0 coiling state and the symmetry-breaking effects induced by the moving belt. \u00a9 2008 The American Physical Society."

This paper reviews how climate change could affect livestock diseases in GB. Factors influenced by climate change and that could affect livestock diseases include the molecular biology of the pathogen itself; vectors (if any); farming practice and land use; zoological and environmental factors; and the establishment of new microenvironments and microclimates. The interaction of these factors is an important consideration in forecasting how livestock diseases may be affected. Risk assessments should focus on looking for combinations of factors that may be directly affected by climate change, or that may be indirectly affected through changes in human activity, such as land use (e.g. deforestation), transport and movement of animals, intensity of livestock farming and habitat change. A risk assessment framework is proposed, based on modules that accommodate these factors. This framework could be used to screen for the emergence of unexpected disease events. \u00a9 2009 The Society for Applied Microbiology."

Therefore, maternal investment in a herd of captive Chinese water deer Hydropotes inermis, a relatively small species of cervid, was investigated over 3 years. Except during the lactation period, reproductive females spent about 2-fold more time resting than feeding. During lactation, the amount of time spent feeding increased highly (25.3 min/h during lactation vs 17.3 min/h during the gestation period). Females spent less than 30% of time in communal behaviours with offspring. They did not reject alien fawns during this care period. Frequency and duration of suckling events decreased exponentially from the second week onwards. More than 10% of suckling bouts were non-filial. Prenatal investment leads to a mean litter mass (about 12% of maternal mass) higher than in most cervid species. Postnatal investment in fawns represents a daily mass gain of ca. 85 g/d during the first 2 weeks, without any sexual difference. Female production, timing and synchrony of births and survival of fawns characterized reproductive success. Seventy percent of mature females gave birth, with a mean of 1.9 offspring per female. The sex ratio was even. Births were synchronous, 80% of births occurring in 25 days. In this herd, 0.74 fawn per female was successfully weaned and 0.56 fawn per female survived through their first year. Based on these results we conclude that reproductive strategy of Chinese water deer was efficient and characterized by mother-offspring relationships typical of hiders and high levels of pre-and postnatal investments. This strategy seems typical of small species of cervids without marked sexual dimorphism. \u00a9 2009 Current Zoology."

It was found that immediately before jumping M. alpina executes primarily unilateral object-related peering movements, with approximately twice the amplitude and velocity of the predominantly bilateral object-related peering movements of the other two species. Whereas M. alpina almost always jumped toward the black stripes in the experimental arena, the other species jumped toward both the black stripes and the white spaces between them. All three species preferred the same pattern of black stripes, which permitted them to view one black stripe frontally, with an additional black stripe to the left and right, in the lateral visual field. The similarities and differences in the peering-jump behavior of the three grasshopper species is discussed with regard to visual perception (parallax cues) and environmental adaptation. \u00a9 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

Nowadays, the insects are a reliable alternative for toxicological analysis, especially when tissues and liquids usually required for this purpose are absent, once insects store some ingested substances which can change their growth rate, being this a relevant fact in the determination of the cause and the time since death. Previous experiments in our laboratory on the testosterone effects on body decomposition suggested that this hormone could interfere in the cadaveric fauna development. With the objective of investigating testosterone influence on the Chrysomya albiceps larval development, a common species in cadaveric fauna, an experimental study was done from eggs of a laboratory maintained colony of this species. The eggs were divided in four groups of 30 and put in glass flasks with 50g of artificial diet in each of them, with testosterone being added in two of them. The larvae were weighted each 12 h during all interval of the larval growing. The studied larvae did not present any difference in the stages of development, but larvae from the experimental group had 5 times the weight of the larvae from the control group and with bigger size. This result shows a significant influence of testosterone in the growth of C. albiceps."

A secondary aim investigated the widely held claim that pig carcasses are reliable surrogates for human corpses. Over a 35-d period in summer 1989, >72,000 invertebrates from three subjects (one human, two pigs) were sampled of which 93% were members of the forensically important (FI) fauna. Performance tests revealed that hand collections, when performed by an experienced forensic entomologist, consistently yielded the largest fraction of FI arthropods from the total invertebrate catch, followed by aerial netting, sticky traps, and pitfall traps, regardless of subject. Pitfall traps and hand collections were broadly effective at sampling both fly and beetle populations, whereas aerial netting and sticky traps mostly targeted flies. The best two-method combination, based on the highest combined catches of FI taxa, were hand collections and pitfall traps, regardless of subject. Between-subject comparisons revealed negligible preference by FI arthropods for human over pig remains. Insofar as our limited comparisons allow with only three study subjects, these results validated the concept of transferability of \"best practices\" from one subject to another and confirmed the claim that pig carcasses (of 23-27-kg starting mass) can substitute for human corpses in research and training programs, at least for summer-exposed and unconcealed remains in the first 5 wk postmortem. \u00a9 2007 Entomological Society of America."

Several concrete measures of the count of degrees of freedom of the theory yield the consistent result that at finite volume, the effective dimensionality is increased by an amount of order 2h/V for a surface of genus h and volume V in string units. This arises in part from an exponentially growing density of states of winding modes supported by the fundamental group, and passes an interesting test of modular invariance. Further evidence for a plethora of examples with the spacelike singularity replaced by a higher dimensional phase arises from the fact that the sigma model on a Riemann surface can be naturally completed by many gauged linear sigma models, whose RG flows approximate time evolution in the full string backgrounds arising from this in the limit of large dimensionality. In recent examples of spacelike singularity resolution by tachyon condensation, the singularity is ultimately replaced by a phase with all modes becoming heavy and decoupling. In the present case, the opposite behavior ensues: more light degrees of freedom arise in the small radius regime. We comment on the emerging zoology of cosmological singularities that results. \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society."

This insect inhabits the litter, manure and soil of poultry houses, feeding on bird manure, cadavers and spilt feed. The lesser mealworm serves as a reservoir of many animal pathogens. Chickens also feed readily on the beetles in infested litter and this sometimes causes nutritional problems and affects weight gain. Current control measures are generally unsatisfactory and microbial control may be a promising strategy to control A. diaperinus. Natural occurrence of entomopathogens is very important for the natural control of insect pests and this paper records the occurrence of Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. on the lesser mealworm in commercial poultry houses, in Brazil. The evaluation was carried out weekly for six months (September/2002 to February/2003). The soil around the poultry house was collected and transferred to Zoology Laboratory from Unioeste, at Cascavel, PR. Infected larvae and adults were always present, but infected pupae were registered twice. Larvae were more susceptible than pupae and adults (incidence ranging from 49% to 100%, mean 74%, 33% to 50%, mean 6.9%; 0.9% to 100%, mean 40.7%, respectively). The pathogenicity of the fungus was confirmed under laboratory conditions following procedures outlined in Koch's postulates."

Historically, agricultural companies were involved in the discovery of conventional insecticide chemistries in processes that were very similar to those in the pharmaceutical industry. With the introduction of GM technologies, the process has radically changed. The new process is best described as the pharmaceutical equivalent of a very large-scale limited clinical trial conducted at the discovery stage. For example, unlike pharmaceutical screens, GM crop discovery screens frequently involve live insects challenged with complex protein-containing soups. Furthermore, the nature of the potential avenues for discovery mandates that assay models also support protein engineering, proteomics, and genomics efforts. The range in sample demand ranges from ultra-low to high throughput. Finally, regulatory and good business stewardship demands that data integrity and tractability is in place, from discovery through varietal introduction, to manage the information generated in support of a commercialized GM plant variety. The authors describe their discovery workflow and detail how they have customized a commercially available database software package to achieve an optimum configuration for entomology screening. \u00a9 2004 The Society for Biomolecular Screening."

A total of 2165 Anopheles was collected, 805 in the rainy season and 1360 in the dry season. Five Anopheles species were identified: Anopheles gambiae s.l., An. funestus, An. hancocki, An. moucheti and An. nili. An. gambiae, An. funestus and An. hancocki, recorded during both seasons, were the main vectors of malaria in the region. An. gambiae s.s. was the only member of the An. gambiae (Giles) complex. These three species had their peak activity between 1 and 2 AM. A human blood index (HBI) of 98.29% was recorded for fed Anopheles. The sporozoite rate, for all vectors together, was significantly higher in the rainy season (9.4%) than in the dry season (4.2%) with all the species infected by Plasmodium falciparum. The average inoculation rate was 0.44 infective bites per man per night, which adds up to 161 infective bites per year in this study area. Analyses of relative abundance and infection rate of malaria vectors at different sites situated along a transect of 20 km during the dry season showed high heterogeneity in biting and sporozoite rates. No malaria vector was caught at 1200 m a.s.l. The mount Cameroon region should be considered an area of high malaria transmission intensity."

In this study, the Belovode zoological collection was examined with the aim of providing data concerning the character of domesticated and transitional animals and wild ancestral forms inhabiting the Central Balkans during neolithic times. A total of 3487 animal bone fragments have been excavated at the site, so far. It was established that the bone remnants chronologically belong to the period of about 5500 - 4800 years B.C. by radiocarbon dating. Morphological comparison showed that almost 42% of the bone remnants were of bovine origin. In order to define the character of the domesticated or wild ancestors of cattle in East Serbia at that time, the bovine collection was further examined in detail. The total of 18 horns/horn bases allowed morphological comparison and morphometric analysis. The data obtained showed that two different ancestors of domesticated cattle were exploited in Belovode: Bos primigenius and Bos brachyceros. Among the archaeological findings were zoomorphic figurines including ox sculptures the shape and details of wich also indicated cattle farming activity in neolithic Belovode."

It was found that the topographical relief and natural vegetation cover significantly influenced the mean values of standardized coefficients of accumulated incidence of ATL in the state (p < 0. 001). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that incidence of the disease was significantly associated with the presence of L. migonei (p = 0. 029), in the municipalities of the Atlantic Plateau geomorphological region (p = 0.005) and those in which predominant vegetation cover was Type V forest (p < 0.001). This analysis reinforces the hypothesis that L. migonei is a vector for Leishmania in Sao Paulo State."

In this study, the effectiveness of this device, a PET sampler, was tested at different sites in the river and the brook throughout the four seasons between 2001-2002. Comparisons were made by PCA and ANOVA, both employing a bootstrap procedure based on similarity matrices. The PET sampler proved to be a reliable tool for detection of seasonal and spatial differences in richness, total abundance of organisms, and Shannon's diversity index in both river and brook and is therefore recommended for use in the monitoring of macro invertebrate communities in this system."

The egg laying declined in the area where urea treated water surface had a mechanical barrier, which allowed volatile fractions to escape, but prevented contact with the water. Urea was shown to act as an oviposition attractant/stimulant for Culex tritaeniorhynchus, but its role was not clear for Cx. vishnui, as the number of egg rafts obtained for the latter species was low."

Recent models of host-parasite co- evolution assume that parasites exert frequency-dependent selection on their hosts by favouring rare alleles that may confer resistance against infection. We tested this prediction in a comparative analysis that sought relationships between levels of genetic variation and the number of metazoan parasite species exploiting each host species. We used data on 40 species of North American freshwater fishes. After controlling for sampling effort and phylogenetic influences, we found no relationship between genetic polymorphism and parasite species richness among fish species. However, we found a marginal negative correlation between parasite species richness and heterozygosity. This result goes against the prediction that increased selective pressure by parasites should be associated with higher levels of genetic variation. Instead, it suggests that parasites may be colonising host species showing low levels of genetic variation with greater success than genetically more variable host species.

All fungicides inhibited both hyphal growth and spore germination of the fungus on the medium. Isoprothiolane inhibited hyphal growth and secondary spore formation even at low concentrations. Spraying isoprothiolane directly onto the green rice leafhopper (Neophotettix cincticeps) inhibited fungal growth, but spraying the fungicide onto rice plants, did not inhibit fungal growth. When the fungicide was sprayed on paddy fields, the population of diseased insects decreased. However, the population of the green rice leafhopper increased. \u00a9 1999, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved."

This virus causes a fatal haemorrhagic disease in Asian elephants, the so-called endothelial inclusion body disease, as reported from North American zoological gardens. In the present work, EIHV-1 was visualized ultrastructurally in affected organ material. Furthermore, a gene block comprising the complete glycoprotein B (gB) and DNA polymerase (DPOL) genes as well as two partial genes was amplified by PCR-based genome walking and sequenced. The gene content and arrangement were similar to those of members of the Betaherpesvirinae. However, phylogenetic analysis with gB and DPOL consistently revealed a very distant relationship to the betaherpesviruses. Therefore, EIHV-1 may be a member of a new genus or even a new herpesvirus subfamily. The sequence information generated was used to set up a nested-PCR assay for diagnosis of suspected cases of endothelial inclusion body disease. Furthermore, it will aid in the development of antibody-based detection methods and of vaccination strategies against this fatal herpesvirus infection in the endangered Asian elephant."

Although structures similar to alar patches or pockets characteristic of most danaid males are lacking in I. similis, electron microscopic examination revealed the presence of modified scales mainly in cell 1A + 2A of the hindwings. Beneath these modified scales were found peculiar integumental structures recognized as secretory organs, which might play an important role in secretion and/or production of danaidone. The findings suggest that in I. similis, unlike other danaid butterflies, the two dihydropyrrolizines may be independently produced in different organs. The average quantity of hydroxydanaidal secreted by the spring population amounted to 48.3\u03bcg/male, while that of the autumn population was only 7.3\u20148.4 \u03bcg/ male. In contrast, the amount of danaidone, with an average of 3.2 (spring) or 2.1 (autumn) \u03bcg/meale, showed no noticable seasonal variation. \u00a9 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

The environmental factors (nymphal density, temperature and photoperiod conditions) affecting wing length variation were also investigated in the laboratory. Adults were collected in Okayama, western Japan, from July to September of 1991. To clarify the effect of nymphal density, first-instar nymphs were reared at densities of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 individuals per Petri dish (9 cm in diameter, 2 cm in depth) under 16L-8D at 30\u00b0C. The effect of temperature was investigated by rearing first-instar nymphs at 20, 25 and 30\u00b0C under 16L-8D at a nymphal density of 8 individuals. To clarify the effect of photoperiod, first-instar nymphs were reared under 8L-16D, 12L-12D and 16L-8D at 30\u00b0C at a nymphal density of 8 individuals. The relative forewing length (RFL) and relative hindwing length (RHL) of adults collected from the field were continuously distributed in both sexes. Environmental factors such as high temperature, short day-length and moderate crowding tended to promote the production of longer hindwinged adults, although no decisive factors were determined. \u00a9 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

The authors used a standardized protocol to determine tick density and infection in numerous forested sites in six Rhode Island towns. An entomologic risk index calculated for each town was compared with the number of human Lyme disease cases reported to the Rhode Island State Health Department for the same year. A strong positive relation between entomologic risk index and the Lyme disease case rate for each town suggested that the entomologic index was predictive of Lyme disease risk."

Larvae or pupae of Andrioplecta pulverula (Meyrick) AndCharacoma ruficirra (Hampson) Were found in the galls. The two moth species did not significantly affect the survival of T. serratae on seven of the eight trees examined. Overall, attack by Megastigmus habui Kamijo Was the most important mortaliy factor for the gall wasp after gall initiation. Larval feeding habits of the two moth species were examined under laboratory conditions. A. pulverula larvae were able to feed on Q. acutissima leaves, but preferred unisexual galls of T. serratae. Some of the A. pulverula larvae boring into the galls fed on the larval cells and their inhabitants. The moth is therefore usually a cecidophage, but often becomes a predator of the gall wasp. Like A. pulverula, C. ruficirra larvae were able to feed on Q. acutissima leaves, but preferred T serratae galls. However, the C. ruficirra larvae boring into the galls did not attack the larval cells, though they could feed on T. serratae larvae that had been artificially exposed. Thus, the larval cell wall of T. serratae functions as a barrier against C. ruficirra larvae. This moth is regarded as a commensal of T. serratae. \u00a9 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved."

Adults began to emerge in 1976. Thereafter, the mean number of adults emerged per tree increased and reached a maximum (7.4 adults per tree) in 1982. The distribution pattern of the emergence holes appearing annually on the host trees changed considerably during the outbreak. The logarithm of the number of adults emerged from each tree correlated positively with tree diameter at breast height (DBH) which was measured in 1979. Most of the trees that the borer killed had previously produced many more adult borers than the trees that had survived the infestation. \u00a9 1993, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

Various environmental factors such as crowding of conspecifics, high temperature and long photoperiod accelerate the production of macropters (Oshiro, 1981; Fujisaki, 1989b). This bug is trivoltine, with the first generation in spring, the second in summer and the third in autumn. The production of macropters in spring and summer generations in response to these environmental factors would be highly adaptive because they can escape from crowded populations and colonize more favourable habitats such as newly planted sugar cane fields (Fujisaki, 1985, 1986, 1989b). Conversely it is expected that both lower temperatures and shorter daylength in the autumn season should lead to the wing reduction in this bug. In this paper, I describe the results of field surveys on the wing reduction of C. saccharivorus adults in the autumn season and discuss the adaptive significance of the wing reduction in this season. \u00a9 1993, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

A sporont gave rise to two spores, and there was no sporophorous vesicle. This microsporidium produced two types of spores, those with 2 to 3 coils and those with 11 to 12 coils of the polar tube during development in Antheraea eucalypti cells. Larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, were not infected by the microsporidium when the spores were administered perorally. Spores of the predominant type, with 11 to 12 polar tube coils, were longer and narrower than those of the corresponding spores of Nosema bombycis. Furthermore they did not react with latex particles, which had been sensitized with a monoclonal antibody against spores of N. bombycis, another isolate of Nosema (M11) or an isolate of Vairimorpha (M12). The new isolate is distinct from N. bombycis and is the second species to be isolated from S. depravata. \u00a9 1994, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved."

For adult longevity and fecundity, mature leaves were the most suitable despite of the beetles\u2019 preference for young leaves. When larvae were fed with senescent leaves, their growth rate decreased and mortality increased. On the other hand, 1st instar larvae did not show a clear preference towards young leaves, and those released under planted hosts could not develop into the next instar when the plant was taller than 10 cm. Therefore, the need to synchronize the egg hatching to host sprout emergence in early spring may have evolved into a unique life cycle of autumn breeding. \u00a9 1994, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

            "text": "Populations of Anopheles (Kerteszia) were sampled fortnightly over a one-year period (August 1991 to July 1992) at Ribeira Valley, S. Paulo State, Brazil. Indoor and outdoor collections were made on human bait at evening crepuscular period. The Polovodova technique for age grading was applied to 3,501 females of Anopheles cruzii and to 416 females of An. bellator. That sample represented 34.4% of the total number of mosquitoes collected. The most abundant species found was An. cruzii. However, An. bellator showed an endophagy that was almost three times greater than that of An. cruzii. The overall parous rate was 25.4% and uniparity was practically dominant one. A proportion of 26.9% of An. cruzii and 12.0% of An. bellator were found to be uniparous. Only three outdoor females of the former species (0.1%) showed biparity. Parity of An. cruzii was higher in females caught indoors than in those caught outdoors. Nevertheless, 497 nulliparous females examined (417 cruzii and 80 bellator) had ovaries that had advanced to Christophers and Mer stages III to V. These results imply that these females had already practised hematophagy. Relating these results to those from the parous females, a high statistical significance was found, leading to the conclusion that gonothophic discordance is a common pattern among these anophelines. Further, these results obtained with human bait catches strongly suggest that nearly 38.0% of these host-seeking females had already taken at least one previous blood-meal. So it is possible that enough time could thus be available for the plasmodian development in the vectors."

The tungro problem in Indonesia has been most serious in Bali where the first outbreak of tungro occurred in the wet season of 1980/81. Large-scale synchronous rice planting, which has been successful in controlling tungro (Sama Et al., 1991), is not implemented in Bali. Irrigation in this province has been managed by a farmer's association, called \u201csubak,\u201d which usually consists of 50\u2013200 farmers. Rice is cultivated either synchronously or asynchronously at the subak level. We compared the population growth pattern of N. virescens between these two different types of rice cultivation areas as a step to develop a forecasting technology of tungro.

            "text": "Background and Objectives: In the Peruvian Amazon, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti is abundant in large urban centers such as Iquitos. In recent years, it has also been found in a number of neighboring rural communities with similar climatic and socioeconomic conditions. To better understand Ae. aegypti spread, we compared characteristics of communities, houses, and containers in infested and uninfested communities. Methods: We conducted pupal-demographic surveys and deployed ovitraps in 34 communities surrounding the city of Iquitos. Communities surveyed were located along two transects: the Amazon River and a 95km highway. We calculated entomological indices, mapped Ae. aegypti presence, and developed univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to predict Ae. aegypti presence at the community, household, or container level. Results: Large communities closer to Iquitos were more likely to be infested with Ae. aegypti. Within infested communities, houses with Ae. aegypti had more passively-filled containers and were more often infested with other mosquito genera than houses without Ae. aegypti. For containers, large water tanks/drums and containers with solar exposure were more likely to be infested with Ae. aegypti. Maps of Ae. aegypti presence revealed a linear pattern of infestation along the highway, and a scattered pattern along the Amazon River. We also identified the geographical limit of Ae. aegypti expansion along the highway at 19.3 km south of Iquitos. Conclusion: In the Peruvian Amazon, Ae. aegypti geographic spread is driven by human transportation networks along rivers and highways. Our results suggest that urban development and oviposition site availability drive Ae. aegypti colonization along roads. Along rivers, boat traffic is likely to drive long-distance dispersal via unintentional transport of mosquitoes on boats. \u00a9 2014."

Given this, the last sixty years have seen many research efforts devoted to this task. To date, however, none of this research has had a lasting impact. In this work, we show that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce superior data; that additional features, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect\u2019s flight behavior, can be exploited to improve insect classification; that a Bayesian classification approach allows to efficiently learn classification models that are very robust to over-fitting, and a general classification framework allows to easily incorporate arbitrary number of features. We demonstrate the findings with large-scale experiments that dwarf all previous works combined, as measured by the number of insects and the number of species considered. \u00a9 JoVE 2006-2014.

            "text": "Introduction: Biological collections are depositories of information on different species and contribute to the knowledge, protection, conservation and maintenance of biodiversity. Methods: A list of triatomine species currently included in the Collection of Chagas Disease Vectors (FIOCRUZ-COLVEC) was prepared from the database made available by the Reference Center on Environmental Information. Results: COLVEC curatorship houses 4,778 specimens of triatomines, of which 811 come from other American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, the United States of America, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) and 3,967 are autochthonous from Brazil. Altogether, 56 species of Chagas disease vectors are represented in the COLVEC: two species of the Tribe Cavernicolini Usinger, 1944; fi fteen species of the tribe Rhodniini Pinto, 1926, of which 12 are of the genus Rhodnius and 3 are of the genus Psamolestes; and 39 species of the tribe Triatomini Jeannel, 1919, represented by the genus Dipetalogaster, two species of the genus Eratyrus, two of the genus Meccus, seven of the genus Panstrongylus and 27 of the genus Triatoma. Conclusions: This list provides important data on the diversity of triatomines currently included in COLVEC, including the expanded area of Panstrongylus lutzi occurrence in the municipalities Pirapora and Janu\u00e1ria, State of Minas Gerais. The maintenance and expansion of the collection ensures the preservation of biodiversity and further studies. \u00a9 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical. All Rights Reserved."

We conducted a study to document risk factors associated with anti-dengue virus Immunoglobulin G seropositivity in humans in three major towns in Cameroon.Methodology/Principal Findings:A cross sectional survey was conducted in Douala, Garoua and Yaounde, using a random cluster sampling design. Participants underwent a standardized interview and were blood sampled. Environmental and housing characteristics were recorded. Randomized houses were prospected to record all water containers, and immature stages of Aedes mosquitoes were collected. Sera were screened for anti-dengue virus IgG and IgM antibodies. Risk factors of seropositivity were tested using logistic regression methods with random effects.Anti-dengue IgG were found from 61.4% of sera in Douala (n = 699), 24.2% in Garoua (n = 728) and 9.8% in Yaounde (n = 603). IgM were found from 0.3% of Douala samples, 0.1% of Garoua samples and 0.0% of Yaounde samples. Seroneutralization on randomly selected IgG positive sera showed that 72% (n = 100) in Douala, 80% (n = 94) in Garoua and 77% (n = 66) in Yaounde had antibodies specific for dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2).Age, temporary house walls materials, having water-storage containers, old tires or toilets in the yard, having no TV, having no air conditioning and having travelled at least once outside the city were independently associated with anti-dengue IgG positivity in Douala. Age, having uncovered water containers, having no TV, not being born in Garoua and not breeding pigs were significant risk factors in Garoua. Recent history of malaria, having banana trees and stagnant water in the yard were independent risk factors in Yaounde.Conclusion/Significance:In this survey, most identified risk factors of dengue were related to housing conditions. Poverty and underdevelopment are central to the dengue epidemiology in Cameroon. \u00a9 2014 Demanou et al."

            "text": "Vector control has been at the core of successful malaria control. However, a dearth of field-oriented vector biologists threatens to undermine global reductions in malaria burden. Skilled cadres are needed to manage insecticide resistance, to maintain coverage with current interventions, to develop new paradigms for tackling 'residual' transmission and to target interventions as transmission becomes increasingly heterogeneous. Recognising this human resource crisis, in September 2013, WHO Global Malaria Programme issued guidance for capacity building in entomology and vector control, including recommendations for countries and implementing partners. Ministries were urged to develop long-range strategic plans for building human resources for public health entomology and vector control (including skills in epidemiology, geographic information systems, operational research and programme management) and to set in place the requisite professional posts and career opportunities. Capacity building and national ownership in all partner projects and a clear exit strategy to sustain human and technical resources after project completion were emphasised. Implementing partners were urged to support global and regional efforts to enhance public health entomology capacity. While the challenges inherent in such capacity building are great, so too are the opportunities to establish the next generation of public health entomologists that will enable programmes to continue on the path to malaria elimination. \u00a9 The Author 2014.

Altogether the material was obtained from six different locations: Banyuls-sur-Mer (France), Tavolara Island (Italy), Elba Island (Italy), Giglio Island (Italy), Sicily Island (Italy), and Istria Peninsula (Croatia). The animals were studied in detail with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

Although this is generally true, Alec Jeffreys' identification of hypervariable repeat motifs in the human beta-globin gene, and the subsequent development of a technology known now as 'DNA fingerprinting', also resulted in a dramatic shift in the life sciences, particularly in ecology, evolutionary biology, and forensics. The variation Jeffreys recognized has been used to identify individuals from tissue samples of not just humans, but also of many animal species. In addition, the technology has been used to determine the sex of individuals, as well as paternity/maternity and close kinship. We review a broad range of such studies involving a wide diversity of animal species. For individual researchers, Jeffreys' invention resulted in many ecologists and evolutionary biologists being given the opportunity to develop skills in molecular biology to augment their whole organism focus. Few developments in science, even among the subsequent genome discoveries of the 21st century, have the same wide-reaching significance. Even the later development of PCR-based genotyping of individuals using microsatellite repeats sequences, and their use in determining multiple paternity, is conceptually rooted in Alec Jeffreys' pioneering work. \u00a9 2014 Chambers et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Female ornaments are common and their function well documented in many species, whether sex role reversed or not. However, sexually selected female weapons seem totally absent except for small wing spurs in three jacana species, present in both males and females. This poor female weaponry is in sharp contrast to the situation in species with conventional sex roles: males com-monly have evolved sexually selected weapons as well as ornaments. At the same time, females in many taxa have naturally se-lected weapons, used in competition over resources or in predator defence. Why are sexually selected weapons then so rare, al-most absent, in females? Here I briefly review weaponry in females and the function of these weapons, conclude that the near ab-sence of sexually selected weapons begs an explanation, and suggest that costs of sexually selected weapons may exceed costs of ornaments. Females are more constrained when evolving sexually selected traits compared to males, at least compared to those males that do not provide direct benefits, as trait costs reduce a female's fecundity. I suggest that this constraining trade-off be-tween trait and fecundity restricts females to evolve ornaments but rarely weapons. The same may apply to paternally investing males. Whether sexually selected weapons actually are more costly than sexually selected ornaments remains to be investigated. \u00a9 2013 Current Zoology."

It was determined that all photonic nanoarchitectures giving a reflectance maximum in the visible range and having an open nanostructure exhibited alteration of the position of the reflectance maximum associated with the photonic nanoarchitectures. The photonic nanoarchitectures with a closed structure exhibited little to no alteration in color. Similarly, control specimens colored by pigments did not exhibit a color change under the same conditions. Hence, this method can be used to identify species with open photonic nanoarchitectures in their scales. For certain species, an almost complete disappearance of the reflectance maximum was found. All specimens recovered their original colors following warming and drying. Cooling experiments using thin copper wires demonstrated that color alterations could be limited to a width of a millimeter or less. Dried museum specimens did not exhibit color changes when cooled in the absence of a heat sink due to the low heat capacity of the wings. \u00a9 This is an open access paper."

However, how animals take measurements to achieve the final design of the structures they construct is known for only very few species. In the Neotropics, a few bat species build roosts or leaf tents that serve different purposes. Thomas's fruit-eating bat (Dermanura watsoni) constructs tents that have complex designs, when compared to other tent building bats. The bifid tent is a design built by producing a long, J-shaped cut on each side of understory plant leaves. We expect that to accomplish this complex design bats would require precise measurements during tent construction. We measured several bat morphological traits to infer which of them, if any, was used by the bats as a measuring device. Dermanura watsoni uses the distance between their lower canines to increase the perpendicular distance of the J-cut to the central vein of the leaf along the J-cut. The bat adds the distance between the canines to each subsequent secondary vein cut. This is the first study to infer which body part D. watsoni most likely uses as a measuring tool. Our results provide new insight into the evolution of body parts as measuring devices during tent construction in related and unrelated tent-building bat species. \u00a9 Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS."

For all the changes undertaken by museums in the last 20 years, sector leaders such as the American Museum of Natural History, the Natural History Museum, London, the National Museum, Prague, Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde, Berlin and the Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris still operate by connecting objects with facts about their biology. The recent relocation of the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London has offered the opportunity for the museum to become a space for dialogue and experimentation.The museum, in collaboration with the university, has developed 'social interpretation' designed to engage visitors with controversial questions in life sciences and museum practice. Visitor responses are recorded and used as the basis to plan future work.The paper explores how this form of engagement with visitors might allow natural history museums to add to established methods of interpretation, and - in a form of co-production with their visitors - challenge attitudes to scientific knowledge and its development. Thus, the way natural history museums function as sources of knowledge for the public and the 'front line' of biological engagement is potentially changed, based on the responses of museum visitors. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

We analyzed whether female mate choice based on males' chemical signals may contribute to a current pre-mating reproductive isolation between two distinct populations of P. hispanica from central Spain. We experimentally examined whether females choose to establish territories on areas scent-marked by males of their own population, versus areas marked by males of the other population. Results showed that females did not prefer scent-marks of males from their own population. In contrast, females seemed to attend mostly to among-individual variation in males' pheromones that did not differ between populations. Finally, to test for strong premating reproductive isolation, we staged intersexual encounters between males and females. The population of origin of males and females did not affect the probability nor the duration of copulations. We suggest that the different environmental conditions in each population might be selecting for different morphologies and different chemical signals of males that maximize efficiency of communication in each environment. However, females in both populations based mate choice on a similar condition-dependent signal of males. Thus, male signals and female mate choice criteria could be precluding premating reproductive isolation between these phenotypically \"distinct\" populations [Current Zoology 59 (2): 210-220, 2013]. \u00a9 2013 Current Zoology."

However simply observing demographic growth of a translocated population is not sufficient to infer species recovery. Adequate genetic representation of the source population(s) and their long-term viability should also be considered. The woylie Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi has been subject to more formal translocations for conservation than any other marsupial that, up until recently, has resulted in one of the most successful species recoveries in Australia. We used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers to assess the genetic outcomes of translocated woylie populations. These populations have lost genetic variability, differentiated from their source population and the supplementation program on two island populations appears to have failed. We discuss the conservation implications that our results have for managing threatened species, outline some general recommendations for the management of present and future translocations and discuss the appropriate sampling design for the establishment of new populations or captive breeding programs that may mitigate the genetic 'erosion' seen in our study species. This research provides some practical outcomes and a pragmatic understanding of translocation biology. The findings are directly applicable to other translocation programs. \u00a9 2013 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Insect hemocytes (equivalent to mammalian white blood cells) play an important role in several physiological processes throughout an insect's life cycle1. In larval stages of insects belonging to the orders of Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and Diptera (true flies), hemocytes are formed from the lymph gland (a specialized hematopoietic organ) or embryonic cells and can be carried through to the adult stage. Embryonic hemocytes are involved in cell migration during development and chemotaxis regulation during inflammation. They also take part in cell apoptosis and are essential for embryogenesis2. Hemocytes mediate the cellular arm of the insect innate immune response that includes several functions, such as cell spreading, cell aggregation, formation of nodules, phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign invaders3. They are also responsible for orchestrating specific insect humoral defenses during infection, such as the production of antimicrobial peptides and other effector molecules4,5. Hemocyte morphology and function have mainly been studied in genetic or physiological insect models, including the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster6,7, the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae8,9 and the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta10,11. However, little information currently exists about the diversity, classification, morphology and function of hemocytes in non-model insect species, especially those collected from the wild12. Here we describe a simple and efficient protocol for extracting hemocytes from wild caterpillars. We use penultimate instar Lithacodes fasciola (yellow-shouldered slug moth) (Figure 1) and Euclea delphinii (spiny oak slug) caterpillars (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae) and show that sufficient volumes of hemolymph (insect blood) can be isolated and hemocyte numbers counted from individual larvae. This method can be used to efficiently study hemocyte types in these species as well as in other related lepidopteran caterpillars harvested from the field, or it can be readily combined with immunological assays designed to investigate hemocyte function following infection with microbial or parasitic organisms13."

As it is a competent vector for several arboviruses, its spread is of increasing public health concern, and there is a need for appropriate monitoring tools. In this paper, we have developed a modelling approach to predict mosquito abundance over time, and identify the main determinants of mosquito population dynamics. The model is temperature- and rainfall-driven, takes into account egg diapause during unfavourable periods, and was used to model the population dynamics of Ae. albopictus in the French Riviera since 2008 Entomological collections of egg stage from six locations in Nice conurbation were used for model validation. We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters of the mosquito population dynamics. Results showed that the model correctly predicted entomological field data (Pearson r correlation coefficient values range from 0.73 to 0.93). The model's main control points were related to adult's mortality rates, the carrying capacity in pupae of the environment, and the beginning of the unfavourable period. The proposed model can be efficiently used as a tool to predict Ae. albopictus population dynamics, and to assess the efficiency of different control strategies. \u00a9 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

His decisive contributions to this science began in the second half of the twentieth century, when he started publishing in the areas of zoology, systematics, biogeography, and the history of science while also working at graduate courses and training teachers and students. He was key to the introduction of Hennig's phylogenetic systematics in Brazil and its chief advocate. His active participation in the creation of the Special Courses on Zoological Systematics within the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and his work at numerous administrative posts which he held during his academic career were vital to the development of zoology and comparative biology in Brazil. His endeavors also reached into other Latin American countries, like Mexico and Argentina."

However, in many cases, humans cannot detect colour differences that are discernible to birds and it is therefore necessary to employ objective methods that contemplate the characteristics of the avian visual system for the study of plumage coloration. An understudied property of feather coloration is the occurrence of fluorescence, which has been described almost exclusively in parrots from the Eastern Hemisphere using non-objective methods and has been attributed to yellow pigments that are only present in psittacids. In this study, we explore fluorescence and sexual dichromatism through objective and quantitative methods in the plumage of a Neotropical species, the blue-winged parrotlet Forpus xanthopterygius. We measured plumage reflectance and fluorescence emission on museum skins using spectrophotometry and spectrofluorometry, respectively. The reflectance analysis revealed the presence of ultraviolet sexual dichromatism that adds to the differences in the visible range of wavelengths that are detectable by humans. The spectrofluorometric analysis showed that fluorescence is indeed present in this species, both in green plumage patches, where fluorescent pigments are presumably located, and in the blue rump of males, where colour is considered to be purely structurally based. The sexes differed in the intensity and wavelength of their fluorescence emission, representing the first finding of fluorescence sexual dichromatism in birds. \u00a9 2012 The Authors.

            "text": "Classic vector control strategies target mosquitoes indoors as the main transmitters of malaria are indoor-biting and -resting mosquitoes. However, the intensive use of insecticide-treated bed-nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying have put selective pressure on mosquitoes to adapt in order to obtain human blood meals. Thus, early-evening and outdoor vector activity is becoming an increasing concern. This study assessed the effect of a deltamethrin-treated net (100 mg/m2) attached to a one-meter high fence around outdoor cattle enclosures on the number of mosquitoes landing on humans. Mosquitoes were collected from four cattle enclosures: Pen A - with cattle and no net; B - with cattle and protected by an untreated net; C - with cattle and protected by a deltamethrin-treated net; D - no cattle and no net. A total of 3217 culicines and 1017 anophelines were collected, of which 388 were Anopheles gambiae and 629 An. ziemanni. In the absence of cattle nearly 3 times more An. gambiae (p<0.0001) landed on humans. The deltamethrin-treated net significantly reduced (nearly three-fold, p<0.0001) culicine landings inside enclosures. The sporozoite rate of the zoophilic An. ziemanni, known to be a secondary malaria vector, was as high as that of the most competent vector An. gambiae; raising the potential of zoophilic species as secondary malaria vectors. After deployment of the ITNs a deltamethrin persistence of 9 months was observed despite exposure to African weather conditions. The outdoor use of ITNs resulted in a significant reduction of host-seeking culicines inside enclosures. Further studies investigating the effectiveness and spatial repellence of ITNs around other outdoor sites, such as bars and cooking areas, as well as their direct effect on vector-borne disease transmission are needed to evaluate its potential as an appropriate outdoor vector control tool for rural Africa. \u00a9 2012 Maia et al."

            "text": "Batesian mimics are harmless prey species that resemble dangerous ones (models), and thus receive protection from predators. How such adaptive resemblances evolve is a classical problem in evolutionary biology. Mimicry is typically thought to be difficult to evolve, especially if the model and mimic produce the convergent phenotype through different proximate mechanisms. However, mimicry may evolve more readily if mimic and model share similar pathways for producing the convergent phenotype. In such cases, these pathways can be co-opted in ancestral mimic populations to produce high-fidelity mimicry without the need for major evolutionary innovations. Here, we show that a Batesian mimic, the scarlet kingsnake Lampropeltis elapsoides, produces its coloration using the same physiological mechanisms as does its model, the eastern coral snake Micrurus fulvius. Therefore, precise color mimicry may have been able to evolve easily in this system. Generally, we know relatively little about the proximate mechanisms underlying mimicry. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

            "text": "BACKGROUND: A modified artificial feeding system was developed for rearing Cimex lectularius and compared with the most widely used artificial feeding method which requires custom-made glassware and a circulating water bath to warm the blood. The petri dish method reduces some of the drawbacks from the current water bath method, such as the possibility of flooding bed bug rearing jars with water or blood and the need for expensive custom-made glassware. RESULTS: Field and lab strain first instar nymphs were given a 15 or 30 min interval to feed for 6-9 weeks. Analysis of bed bugs that fed during a 6 week time period showed that there was no significant difference in the numbers that fed using the petri dish method compared with those that fed using the water bath method. Development of the nymphs also showed that there was no significant difference in the time required to produce adults by either method. CONCLUSION: The petri dish method is an attractive alternative to the water bath method. Set-up is less complex, quicker, multiple jars of bed bugs can be fed at the same time, petri dishes of blood are disposable for easy clean-up and the potential of fatality due to flooding with blood or water is reduced. \u00a9 2013 Society of Chemical Industry."

            "text": "There are many situations in which the ability of animals to distinguish between two similar looking objects can have significant selective consequences. For example, the objects that require discrimination may be edible versus defended prey, predators versus non-predators, or mates of varying quality. Working from the premise that there are situations in which discrimination may be more or less successful, we hypothesized that individuals find it more difficult to distinguish between stimuli when they encounter them sequentially rather than simultaneously. Our study has wide biological and psychological implications from the perspective of signal perception, signal evolution, and discrimination, and could apply to any system where individuals are making relative judgments or choices between two or more stimuli or signals. While this is a general principle that might seem intuitive, it has not been experimentally tested in this context, and is often not considered in the design of models or experiments, or in the interpretation of a wide range of studies. Our study is different from previous studies in psychology in that a) the level of similarity of stimuli are gradually varied to obtain selection gradients, and b) we discuss the implications of our study for specific areas in ecology, such as the level of perfection of mimicry in predator-prey systems. Our experiments provide evidence that it is indeed more difficult to distinguish between stimuli and to learn to distinguish between stimuli - when they are encountered sequentially rather than simultaneously, even if the intervening time interval is short. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

Nineteen parasite morphotypes were detected in the fecal samples from populations of the two howler monkeys, of which 58% were shared by both species. When considering all parasite species, populations of the two howler species were more likely to be parasitized in fragmented habitat compared to continuous habitat. Individuals of both howler monkey species that lived in fragmented habitat had a higher prevalence of Controrchis biliophilus. A. p. mexicana individuals had a higher prevalence of Trypanoxyuris minutus than A. pigra, probably the result of the larger group sizes found in the former species, and T. minutus was more likely to be found in A. palliata individuals that lived in fragmented habitat. Adult A. p. mexicana males had a higher risk of being parasitized compared to adult females, but these differences were not detected in A. pigra. Parasite species such as Entamoeba sp., Nematoda sp. 28, Nematoda sp. B and Parabronema sp. where only found during the wet season in both howler monkey species. Populations of both howler monkey species had a higher prevalence of Nematoda sp. A in the wet season and Ascaridae eggs were only detected during the wet season in A. pigra. Other parasites detected displayed no clear seasonal pattern. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

In that coat coloration is associated with differences in physiological and behavioral traits, coat color may affect the attractiveness of odor cues produced by conspecifics. Individuals may be able to respond preferentially to conspecifics with a particular coat color. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that scent marks of brown and blond voles differ in their attractiveness to male and female conspecifics. Male voles and brown females did not discriminate between blond- and brown-coated opposite-sex conspecifics suggesting that they are neither selecting potential mates dissociatively nor associatively. However, blond females behaved as if the scent marks of blond males were more attractive than were the scent marks of brown males. Our data suggest that blond females who are already conspicuous to predators, may select blond males as mates because they do not appreciably increase the risk of detection to predators, particularly avian predators. Moreover, because these conspicuous males have survived to mate they may have good genes that reflect their relatively higher quality. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

            "text": "The differential allocation hypothesis predicts individuals will increase their reproductive investment when mated to a high quality partner. In many species of fish with biparental care females prefer large males due to the males' greater ability to raise more offspring to independence. I examined the relationship between mate quality, parental care and number of offspring in a natural population of convict cichlids Amatitlania siquia. The frequency of frontal displays by females was positively correlated with male standard length. Additionally, as males increased in length relative to their mate, females increased the frequency of chases towards predators, while males decreased the number of displays towards brood predators. This trade-off in parental effort within a pair due to mate quality is a key prediction of differential allocation. The number of offspring was correlated with male, but not female, standard length. These results support the differential allocation hypothesis in that females offered more parental care to offspring of a larger male, while their mates decreased the amount of care they provided. Additionally, females benefited in terms of number of offspring by pairing with higher quality mates. Increased female investment may provide an incentive to ensure male care and maintain pair bonding, which could lead to greater reproductive success through increased offspring survival. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

Tuberculatus quercicola has two winged morphs in its life cycle, winged females appear in summer and sexual males appear in autumn. Previous studies have shown that wing loading (ratio of body volume to wing area) is higher for the winged females, because of ant attendance, resulting in extremely low dispersal. It is known that the nutritional quality of host plants is high in spring and autumn, when leaves are growing or senescent, and low in summer when leaves are mature. This study examined the effects of seasonal plant deterioration on the development of flight apparatus (wing size and flight muscle) of winged females and males. Moreover, field intercept traps were used to examine the extent of dispersal of males. The results showed that seasonal plant deterioration affected development of the flight apparatus of winged females, particularly flight muscle. Flight muscle development was significantly higher in winged males in autumn than in winged females. However, winged males were not caught in any of the traps. The different resource allocation to the flight apparatus of winged females and males is discussed. \u00a9 2012 The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology."

            "text": "Lately, there has been an increasing interest in intraspecific variation in behaviour, and numerous studies on personality have been performed in a variety of animals, including several fish species. Individuals have been divided into coping style categories or arranged along a behaviour gradient, such as the bold/shy continuum. However, many fish species live in groups, and the social environment can influence the behaviour of an animal in different ways. There may be conflicts within groups due to competition for resources, and dominance hierarchies are commonly found. On the other hand, there are many benefits of consensus decision-making within the group. Conformity of behaviour is probably adaptive, due to the benefit of public information on, for example, food resources and predation risk. Accordingly, studies of fish shoals have found evidence of consensus decision- making. Furthermore, factors in the environment, such as predation risk would also influence the behaviour expressed. To be able to understand behaviour patterns in a group of fish, it is necessary to consider the variation of individual characteristics, and how the group, as well as other environmental factors, affects the behaviour of individuals. Here, I will review studies on different aspects of personality within a social context in fish, with a special emphasis on the Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis. \u00a9 2012 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Background: In the Veneto region (north-eastern Italy) an entomological surveillance system has been implemented since the introduction of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in 1991. During the routine monitoring activity in a tiger mosquito-free area, an unexpected mosquito was noticed, which clearly did not belong to the recorded Italian fauna. Findings. At the end of May 2011, twelve larvae and pupae were collected in a small village in Belluno province (Veneto region) from a single manhole. Ten adults reared in the laboratory were morphologically and genetically identified as Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus (Edwards, 1917), a species native to Southeast Asia. The subsequent investigations carried out in the following months in the same village provided evidence that this species had become established locally. Entomological and epidemiological investigations are currently ongoing in the surrounding area, to verify the eventual extension of the species outside the village and to trace back the route of entry into Italy. Conclusions: This is the first report in Italy of the introduction of the exotic mosquito Ae. koreicus. This species has been shown experimentally to be competent in the transmission of the Japanese encephalitis virus and of the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis and is considered a potential vector of other arboviruses. Thus, the establishment of this species may increase the current risk or pose new potential threats, for human and animal health. This finding considerably complicates the entomological monitoring of the Asian tiger mosquito Ae. albopictus in Italy and stresses the importance of implementing the entomological surveillance for the early detection of and the rapid response against invasive mosquito species. \u00a9 2011 Capelli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

MP and Bayesian analysis results using COI and Cyt b datasets, and combined MP, ML and Bayesian analysis of both were consistent with a morphologically supported monophyly. Subdivision of the genus into two subgenera was strongly supported. Samples of each included species form monophyletic clade, respectively; and the result implied the valid status of related species in this genus. These results suggest some surprising hypotheses regarding the phylogeography of the genus: the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, reorganization of major river catchments and the isolation of Hainan Island were probably important factors contributing to the diversification of species in this genus. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

Tangjiahe Nature Reserve (NR) is one of the most important national reserves for giant pandas Ailuropoda melanoleuca in China. Previous studies have shown that giant pandas in Tangjiahe NR may be threatened by population decline and fragmentation. Here we used 10 microsatellite DNA markers to assess the genetic variability in the Tangjiahe population. The results indicate a low level of genetic differentiation between the Hongshihe and Motianling subpopulations in the reserve. Assignment tests using the Bayesian clustering method in STRUCTURE identified one genetic cluster from 42 individuals of the two subpopulations. All individuals from the same subpopulation were assigned to one cluster. This indicates high gene flow between subpopulations. F statistic analyses revealed a low FIS-value of 0.024 in the total population and implies a randomly mating population in Tangjiahe NR. Additionally, our data show a high level of genetic diversity for the Tangjiahe population. Mean allele number (A), Allelic richness (AR) and mean expected heterozygosity (HE) for the Tangjiahe population was 5.9, 5.173 and 0.703, respectively. This wild giant panda population can be restored through concerted effort. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."

            "text": "Background: The emergence and massive spread of bluetongue in Western Europe during 2006-2008 had disastrous consequences for sheep and cattle production and confirmed the ability of Palaearctic Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) to transmit the virus. Some aspects of Culicoides ecology, especially host-seeking and feeding behaviors, remain insufficiently described due to the difficulty of collecting them directly on a bait animal, the most reliable method to evaluate biting rates. Our aim was to compare typical animal-baited traps (drop trap and direct aspiration) to both a new sticky cover trap and a UV-light/suction trap (the most commonly used method to collect Culicoides). Methods/results. Collections were made from 1.45 hours before sunset to 1.45 hours after sunset in June/July 2009 at an experimental sheep farm (INRA, Nouzilly, Western France), with 3 replicates of a 4 sites \u00d7 4 traps randomized Latin square using one sheep per site. Collected Culicoides individuals were sorted morphologically to species, sex and physiological stages for females. Sibling species were identified using a molecular assay. A total of 534 Culicoides belonging to 17 species was collected. Abundance was maximal in the drop trap (232 females and 4 males from 10 species) whereas the diversity was the highest in the UV-light/suction trap (136 females and 5 males from 15 species). Significant between-trap differences abundance and parity rates were observed. Conclusions: Only the direct aspiration collected exclusively host-seeking females, despite a concern that human manipulation may influence estimation of the biting rate. The sticky cover trap assessed accurately the biting rate of abundant species even if it might act as an interception trap. The drop trap collected the highest abundance of Culicoides and may have caught individuals not attracted by sheep but by its structure. Finally, abundances obtained using the UV-light/suction trap did not estimate accurately Culicoides biting rate. \u00a9 2011 Viennet et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Ifakara tent traps (ITT) are currently the only sufficiently sensitive, safe, affordable and practical method for routine monitoring host-seeking mosquito densities in Dar es Salaam. However, it is not clear whether ITT catches represent indoors or outdoors biting densities. ITT do not yield samples of resting, fed mosquitoes for blood meal analysis. Methods. Outdoors mosquito sampling methods, namely human landing catch (HLC), ITT (Design B) and resting boxes (RB) were conducted in parallel with indoors sampling using HLC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps (LT) and RB as well as window exit traps (WET) in urban Dar es Salaam, rotating them thirteen times through a 3 \u00d7 3 Latin Square experimental design replicated in four blocks of three houses. This study was conducted between 6th May and 2rd July 2008, during the main rainy season when mosquito biting densities reach their annual peak. Results. The mean sensitivities of indoor RB, outdoor RB, WET, LT, ITT (Design B) and HLC placed outdoor relative to HLC placed indoor were 0.01, 0.005, 0.036, 0.052, 0.374, and 1.294 for Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (96% An. gambiae s.s and 4% An. arabiensis), respectively, and 0.017, 0.053, 0.125, 0.423, 0.372 and 1.140 for Culex spp, respectively. The ITT (Design B) catches correlated slightly better to indoor HLC (r2 = 0.619, P < 0.001, r2 = 0.231, P = 0.001) than outdoor HLC (r2 = 0.423, P < 0.001, r2 = 0.228, P = 0.001) for An. gambiae s.l. and Culex spp respectively but the taxonomic composition of mosquitoes caught by ITT does not match those of the indoor HLC (\u03c72 = 607.408, degrees of freedom = 18, P < 0.001). The proportion of An. gambiae caught indoors was unaffected by the use of an LLIN in that house. Conclusion. The RB, WET and LT are poor methods for surveillance of malaria vector densities in urban Dar es Salaam compared to ITT and HLC but there is still uncertainty over whether the ITT best reflects indoor or outdoor biting densities. The particular LLIN evaluated here failed to significantly reduce house entry by An. gambiae s.l. suggesting a negligible repellence effect. \u00a9 2011 Govella et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "Background: Malaria has recently re-emerged as a public health burden in Colombia. Although the problem seems to be climate-driven, there remain significant gaps of knowledge in the understanding of the complexity of malaria transmission, which have motivated attempts to develop a comprehensive model. Methods: The mathematical tool was applied to represent Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in two endemic-areas. Entomological exogenous variables were estimated through field campaigns and laboratory experiments. Availability of breeding places was included towards representing fluctuations in vector densities. Diverse scenarios, sensitivity analyses and instabilities cases were considered during experimentation-validation process. Results: Correlation coefficients and mean square errors between observed and modelled incidences reached 0.897-0.668 (P > 0.95) and 0.0002-0.0005, respectively. Temperature became the most relevant climatic parameter driving the final incidence. Accordingly, malaria outbreaks are possible during the favourable epochs following the onset of El Ni\u00f1o warm events. Sporogonic and gonotrophic cycles showed to be the entomological key-variables controlling the transmission potential of mosquitoes' population. Simulation results also showed that seasonality of vector density becomes an important factor towards understanding disease transmission. Conclusion: The model constitutes a promising tool to deepen the understanding of the multiple interactions related to malaria transmission conducive to outbreaks. In the foreseeable future it could be implemented as a tool to diagnose possible dynamical patterns of malaria incidence under several scenarios, as well as a decision-making tool for the early detection and control of outbreaks. The model will be also able to be merged with forecasts of El Ni\u00f1o events to provide a National Malaria Early Warning System. \u00a9 2006 Ruiz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The traps captured 65, 214 males and 18 females from July, 1989 to December, 1990. In the pheromone-treated field, the sex ratio of the population largely skewed to female and the mating rate of females was reduced. The density of weevils was notably decreased in the pheromone-treated field, probably due to male annihilation and mating disturbance. Thus, mass-trapping is promising as a controlling agent against the sweet potato weevil. \u00a9 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved."

In environments where signal transmission is highly variable, signalers may utilize complex signals, which incorporate multiple components and modalities, to maintain effective communication. Male Rabidosa rabida wolf spiders produce complex courtship signals, consisting of both visual and seismic components. We test the hypothesis that the complex signaling of R. rabida contributes to male reproductive success in variable signaling environments. We first examine the condition-dependence of foreleg ornamentation (a presumed visual signal) and seismic signal components and find that both may provide potentially redundant information on foraging history. Next, we assessed reproductive success across manipulated signaling environments that varied in the effectiveness of visual and/or seismic signal transmission. In environments where only one signal could be successfully transmitted (e.g., visual or seismic), pairs were still able to successfully copulate. Additionally, we found that males altered their courtship display depending on the current signaling environment. Specifically, males reduced their use of a visual display component in signaling environments where visual signal transmission was ablated. Incorporating signals in multiple modalities not only enables R. rabida males to maintain copulation success across variable signaling environments, but it also enables males to adjust their composite courtship display to current signaling conditions. \u00a9 2011 Current Zoology."
