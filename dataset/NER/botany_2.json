Lipid content of wild eel muscle had the highest oil yield (22.29%) than the breeding one (16.11%). Interestingly, the fatty acids (FA) profiles exhibited a dominance of unsaturated ones exceeding 60% of the total FA content. The omega-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) profiles exhibited a dominance of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in eel samples. The lipid health indexes and the predominance of PUFAs acids in both studied eel muscle samples could meet people's needs. Interestingly, a higher stability of peroxide values was observed during the storage for 30\u00a0days at \u221220 \u00b0C, which allows higher oils stability. In vitro digestibility model showed that eel oils were efficiently hydrolyzed by a pancreatic lipase, which suggests the higher assimilation of these oils in the human digestive tract. Practical applications: The production of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentrates from residual sources of marine oils obtained from discarded parts of fish processing have unexplored potential of use in food industry, and oil-based nutraceutical production for obtaining the health benefits can be achieved. The economic activities of fish residues can reduce inappropriate extractive fishing, reducing imports of fish oils while contributing to the ecosystem balance. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Both N-deficiency and an excess of N inhibited the growth and development of pear rootstocks. However, different visible symptoms were observed among treated leaves and roots. Leaf yellowing, the stimulation of root elongation, a decrease in nitrate reductase activity and chlorophyll content were observed under N-deficiency conditions. On the other hand, dark green leaves accompanied by coking, the suppression of root elongation, and a decrease in nitrate reductase activity and chlorophyll content were displayed under regimes of excess N. In addition, not only the N content, but also the content of other mineral nutrients was influenced by nitrate treatments. Taken together, these results suggested that a careful choice of N fertilizer supply is crucial to ensure normal growth and development in pear trees. \u00a9 2018 Chen, Wang, Fabrice, Tian, Qi, Chen, Cao, Wang, Zhang, Wu and Tao."

Before entering the host tissues, this pathogen has an epiphytic growth phase on kiwifruit flowers and leaves, thus the ecological interactions within epiphytic bacterial community may greatly influence the onset of the infection process. The bacterial community associated to the two most important cultivated kiwifruit species, Actinidia chinensis and Actinidia deliciosa, was described both on flowers and leaves using Illumina massive parallel sequencing of the V3 and V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, the effect of plant infection by Psa on the epiphytic bacterial community structure and biodiversity was investigated. Psa infection affected the phyllosphere microbiome structures in both species, however, its impact was more pronounced on A. deliciosa leaves, where a drastic drop in microbial biodiversity was observed. Furthermore, we also showed that Psa was always present in syndemic association with Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and Pseudomonas viridiflava, two other kiwifruit pathogens, suggesting the establishment of a pathogenic consortium leading to a higher pathogenesis capacity. Finally, the analyses of the dynamics of bacterial populations provided useful information for the screening and selection of potential biocontrol agents against Psa. \u00a9 2018 Purahong, Orr\u00f9, Donati, Perpetuini, Cellini, Lamontanara, Michelotti, Tacconi and Spinelli."

Emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccon Schrank), one of the first wheat species domesticated, carries significant variation for tolerance to abiotic stresses. This study identified new genetic variability for high-temperature tolerance in hexaploid progeny derived from crosses with emmer wheat. Eight hexaploid and 11 tetraploid parents were recombined in 43 backcross combinations using the hexaploid as the recurrent parent. A total of 537 emmer-based hexaploid lines were developed by producing approximately 10 doubled haploids on hexaploid like BC1F1 progeny and subsequent selection for hexaploid morphology. These materials and 17 commercial cultivars and hexaploid recurrent parents were evaluated under two times of sowing in the field, in 2014\u20132016. The materials were genotyped using a 90K SNP platform and these data were used to estimate the contribution of emmer wheat to the progeny. Significant phenotypic and genetic variation for key agronomical traits including grain yield, TKW and screenings was observed. Many of the emmer derived lines showed improved performance under heat stress (delayed sowing) compared with parents and commercial cultivars. Emmer derived lines were the highest yielding material in both sowing dates. The emmer wheat parent contributed between 1 and 44% of the genome of the derived lines. Emmer derived lines with superior kernel weight and yield generally had a greater genetic contribution from the emmer parent compared to those with lower trait values. The study showed that new genetic variation for key traits such as yield, kernel weight and screenings can be introduced to hexaploid wheat from emmer wheat. These genetic resources should be explored more systematically to stabilize grain yield and quality in a changing climate. \u00a9 2018 Ullah, Bramley, Daetwyler, He, Mahmood, Thistlethwaite and Trethowan."

Growing resistant varieties is the most economical and environmentally friendly control measure. Recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations from the crosses of susceptible parent \u2018Cacuke\u2019 with the resistant parents \u2018Huhwa\u2019 and \u2018Yaye\u2019 were phenotyped for resistance at the seedling stage to Pgt race TTKSK (Ug99) and in adult plants in field trials at Njoro, Kenya for two seasons in 2016. Using the Affymetrix Axiom breeders SNP array, two stem rust resistance genes, temporarily designated as SrH and SrY, were identified and mapped on chromosome arm 2BL through selective genotyping and bulked segregant analysis (BSA), respectively. Kompetitive allele specific polymorphism (KASP) markers and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to saturate chromosome arm 2BL in both RIL populations. SrH mapped between markers cim109 and cim114 at a distance of 0.9 cM proximal, and cim117 at 2.9 cM distal. SrY was flanked by markers cim109 and cim116 at 0.8 cM proximal, and IWB45932 at 1.9 cM distal. Two Ug99-effective stem rust resistance genes derived from bread wheat, Sr9h and Sr28, have been reported on chromosome arm 2BL. Infection types and map position in Huhwa and Yaye indicated that Sr28 was absent in both the parents. However, susceptible reactions produced by resistant lines from both populations against Sr9h-virulent race TTKSF+ confirmed the presence of a common resistance locus Sr9h in both lines. Test of allelism is required to establish genetic relationships between genes identified in present study and Sr9h. Marker cim117 linked to SrH was genotyped on set of wheat lines with Huhwa in the pedigree and is advised to be used for marker assisted selection for this gene, however, a combination of phenotypic and genotypic assays is desirable for both genes especially for selection of Sr9h in breeding programs. \u00a9 2018 Randhawa, Singh, Dreisigacker, Bhavani, Huerta-Espino, Rouse, Nirmala and Sandoval-Sanchez."

These effects have been studied mostly across generations of sexually reproducing species. A substantial proportion of plant species are however reproducing asexually, for instance via clonal growth. TGE are thought to be enabled by heritable epigenetic modification of DNA, although unambiguous evidence is still scarce. On the clonal herb white clover (Trifolium repens), we tested the generality of clonal TGE across five genotypes and five parental environments including soil contamination and above-ground competition. Moreover, by genome wide-methylation variation analysis we explored the role of drought, one of the parental environments that triggered the strongest TGE. We tested the induction of epigenetic changes in offspring generations using several intensities and durations of drought stress. We found that TGE of different environments were highly genotype specific and all tested environments triggered TGE at least in some genotypes. In addition, parental drought stresses triggered epigenetic change in T. repens and most of the induced epigenetic change was maintained across several clonal offspring generations. We conclude that TGE are common and genotype specific in clonal plant T. repens and potentially under epigenetic control. \u00a9 2018 Rendina Gonz\u00e1lez, Preite, Verhoeven and Latzel."

            "text": "Sulfite reductase (SIR) is a key enzyme in higher plants in the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway. SIR, being exclusively localized in plastids, catalyzes the reduction of sulfite (SO3                             2\u2212) to sulfide (S2\u2212) and is essential for plant life. We characterized transgenic plants leading to co-suppression of the SIR gene in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun NN). Co-suppression resulted in reduced but not completely extinguished expression of SIR and in a reduction of SIR activity to about 20\u201350% of the activity in control plants. The reduction of SIR activity caused chlorotic and necrotic phenotypes in tobacco leaves, but with varying phenotype strength even among clones and increasing from young to old leaves. In transgenic plants compared to control plants, metabolite levels upstream of SIR accumulated, such as sulfite, sulfate and thiosulfate. The levels of downstream metabolites were reduced, such as cysteine, glutathione (GSH) and methionine. This metabolic signature resembles a sulfate deprivation phenotype as corroborated by the fact that O-acetylserine (OAS) accumulated. Further, chlorophyll contents, photosynthetic electron transport, and the contents of carbohydrates such as starch, sucrose, fructose, and glucose were reduced. Amino acid compositions were altered in a complex manner due to the reduction of contents of cysteine, and to some extent methionine. Interestingly, sulfide levels remained constant indicating that sulfide homeostasis is crucial for plant performance and survival. Additionally, this allows concluding that sulfide does not act as a signal in this context to control sulfate uptake and assimilation. The accumulation of upstream compounds hints at detoxification mechanisms and, additionally, a control exerted by the downstream metabolites on the sulfate uptake and assimilation system. Co-suppression lines showed increased sensitivity to additionally imposed stresses probably due to the accumulation of reactive compounds because of insufficient detoxification in combination with reduced GSH levels. \u00a9 2018 Naumann, Hubberten, Watanabe, H\u00e4nsch, Sch\u00f6ttler and Hoefgen."

The influence of two fundamental factors on the bending strength and stiffness was considered: The wood species used for the webs and pretensioning with unbonded tendons. Sixteen specimens with a 9 m span were tested until failure: Eight of them were nontensioned (4 Picea abies webs and 4 Quercus robur webs) and the other eight were pretensioned using threaded bars with 20 mm diameter anchored in plates fixed at the ends of the specimens (4 Picea abies webs and 4 Quercus robur webs). Pretensioning with unbonded tendons showed a clear improvement in the load capacity of the specimens with Picea abies webs, while the difference was not significant for the specimens with Quercus robur webs. Considering deflection, pretensioning gave the advantage of an initial precamber but also generated slight variations in the stiffness as a result of increasing the portion of the section that was in compression. The variation in the stiffness depended on the relation between the compressive and tensile moduli of elasticity parallel to the grain, and its influence on the deflection was analyzed using a finite element method. \u00a9 2018 J.

It discusses at length both basic and applied aspects of fungi and provides up-to-date laboratory-based data. Of the estimated three million species of fungi on Earth, according to Hawksworth and coworkers, more than 100,000 have been described to date. Many fungi produce toxins, organic acids, antibiotics and other secondary metabolites, and are sources of useful biocatalysts such as cellulases, xylanases, proteases and pectinases, to mention a few. They can also cause diseases in animals as well as plants and many are able to break down complex organic molecules such as lignin and pollutants like xenobiotics, petroleum and polycyclic aromatic compounds. Current research on mushrooms focuses on their hypoglycemic, anti-cancer, anti-pathogenic and immunity-enhancing activities.

This paper describes a successful utilization of process condition optimization and modeling of the solvent extraction of phenolic compounds from IPW with preserved high antiradical and/or antioxidant activity. They are value added products with potential commercial application in food industries and preventive medicine due to their well-known beneficial health effects. Process conditions to maximize the total phenolic content (TPC), hydrolysable tannins (HT), total flavonoids (TF), radical scavenging activity (assessed as DPPH%) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), were considered as optimal extraction conditions. HT as major constituents of TPC (about 50%) were also characterized and quantified by LC/MASS analysis. The optimum operating conditions were an ethanol concentration of 60%, a solvent to dry waste ratio of 30\u00a0mL/g, the temperature of 46\u00b0C and the time of 6\u00a0h, which were also successfully implemented in a pilot plant scale. The FRAP and the DPPH results correlated to the TPC and the HT, and were influenced mostly by the solvent to dry waste ratio, followed by the ethanol composition. Other objectives considered in the present study included reductions in the process steps and operating costs, the use of an environmental friendly extraction solvent and its recovery, and the minimization of waste. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V."

A detailed annotation of enzymatic activities and structure-function relationships remains an important prerequisite to understand PNPLA functions in (patho-)physiology, for example, in disorders such as neutral lipid storage disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and neurodegenerative syndromes. In this study, we characterized the structural features controlling the subcellular localization and enzymatic activity of PNPLA7, a poorly annotated phospholipase linked to insulin signaling and energy metabolism.Weshow thatPNPLA7is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that specifically promotes hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine in mammalian cells. We found that transmembrane and regulatory domains in the PNPLA7 N-terminal region cooperate to regulate ER targeting but are dispensable for substrate hydrolysis. Enzymatic activity is instead mediated by the C-terminal domain, which maintains full catalytic competence even in the absence of N-terminal regions. Upon elevated fatty acid flux, the catalytic domain targets cellular lipid droplets and promotes interactions of PNPLA7 with these organelles in response to increased cAMP levels. We conclude that PNPLA7 acts as an ER-anchored lysophosphatidylcholine hydrolase that is composed of specific functional domains mediating catalytic activity, subcellular positioning, and interactions with cellular organelles. Our study provides critical structural insights into an evolutionarily conserved class of phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes. \u00a9 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

Gaining insight into how slope ecosystems function and evolve could make eco-engineering interventions on slopes more successful. The objective of the present study is to detect traits of shallow landslide-triggered ecosystem evolution, self-regulation and biophysical diversity in a small-scale landslide-prone slope in Northeast Scotland. A protocol was defined to explore the emergence of landslide-driven slope habitats. This protocol studied plant diversity, species richness and plant biomass differences and their interactions with certain soil and topographic attributes at three slope strata during two consecutive growing seasons following an assemblage of shallow landslide events. Plant species and soil properties with potential as indicators of the different landslide-driven slope habitats and landscape evolution were also considered. Shallow landslides contributed to biophysical diversity and created distinct slope habitats within the landscape. Habitat differences in terms of species richness and composition were a direct consequence of the slope self-regulation. Certain plant species were found to be valid indicators of landslide-driven biophysical diversity. Soil total nitrogen and resistance to penetration were related to slope habitat and landscape evolution. As expected, plant establishment relied upon light and nitrogen trade-offs, which in turn were influenced by landscape topography. The insights derived from this study will be useful in slope restoration, particularly in harmonising effective actions with the functioning of landslide-prone ecosystems. Further research directions to clarify the observed variability and interactions are highlighted. \u00a9 2017, The Author(s)."

Currently used MTGs have low substrate specificity, impeding their biotechnological use as enzymes that do not cross-react with nontarget substrates (i.e. as bio-orthogonal labeling systems). Here, we report the discovery of an MTG from Kutzneria albida (KalbTG), which exhibited no cross-reactivity with known MTG substrates or commonly used target proteins, such as antibodies. KalbTG was produced in Escherichia coli as soluble and active enzyme in the presence of its natural inhibitor ammonium to prevent potentially toxic cross-linking activity. The crystal structure of KalbTG revealed a conserved core similar to other MTGs but very short surface loops, making it the smallest MTG characterized to date. Ultra-dense peptide array technology involving a pool of 1.4 million unique peptides identified specific recognition motifs for KalbTG in these peptides. We determined that the motifs YRYRQ and RYESK are the best Gln and Lys substrates of KalbTG, respectively. By first reacting a bifunctional-ized peptide with the more specific KalbTG and in a second step with the less specific MTG from Streptomyces mobaraensis, a successful bio-orthogonal labeling system was demonstrated. Fusing the KalbTG recognition motif to an antibody allowed for site-specific and ratio-controlled labeling using low label excess. Its site specificity, favorable kinetics, ease of use, and cost-effective production render KalbTG an attractive tool for a broad range of applications, including production of therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates. \u00a9 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

Through the work, we identified many MOFs and zeolites with high selectivity (SL+M > 10) for the group of n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, and 3-methylpentane (linear and monobranched isomers) versus 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane (dibranched isomers). This group of selective sorbents includes VICDOC (Fe2(BDP)3), a MOF with triangular pores that is known to exhibit high isomer selectivity and capacity. For three of these structures, the adsorption isotherms for a 10-component mixture of hexane and heptane isomers were calculated. Subsequent simulations of column breakthrough curves showed that the DEYVUA MOF exhibits a longer process cycle time than VICDOC MOF or MRE zeolite, which are previously reported, high-performing materials, illustrating the importance of capacity in designing MOFs for practical applications. Among the identified candidates, we synthesized and characterized a MOF in a new copper form with high predicted adsorbent capacity (qL+M > 1.2 mol/L) and moderately high selectivity (SL+M \u2248 10). Finally, we examined the role of pore shape in hexane isomer separations, especially of triangular-shaped pores. We show through the potential energy surface and three-dimensional siting analyses that linear alkanes do not populate the corners of narrow triangular channels and that structures with nontriangular pores can efficiently separate hexane isomers. Detailed thermodynamic analysis illustrates how differences in the free energy of adsorption contribute to shape-selective separation in nanoporous materials. \u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society."

The leaf extracts contained high amounts of flavonols: quercetin, quercitrin, and rutin (62.1\u2013367.0\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g DW), as well as chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, and rosmarinic acid (max. 724.2, 482.7, 154.7\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g DW, respectively). Of the examined materials, A. arbutifolia leaves were characterized by the highest total phenolics content (9148.2\u00a0mg gal. ac. Eq./100\u00a0g DW) and showed the highest antioxidant activity in DPPH and FRAP assays. The results demonstrate that fruits of A. arbutifolia and A. \u00d7prunifolia are a rich source of antioxidants and can be used as plant raw materials, alternatively to A. melanocarpa berries. Leaves of the investigated species are of potential therapeutic and dietary interest because of their high flavonol and phenolic acid content. \u00a9 2017, The Author(s)."

The most commonly used method for plant density quantification is based on visual counting from ground level. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a method for estimating wheat plant density at the emergence stage based on high resolution imagery taken from UAV at very low altitude with application to high throughput phenotyping in field conditions. A Sony ILCE \u03b15100L RGB camera with 24\u00a0Mpixels and equipped with a 60\u00a0mm focal length lens was flying aboard an hexacopter at 3 to 7\u00a0m altitude at about 1\u00a0m/s speed. This allows getting ground resolution between 0.20\u00a0mm to 0.45\u00a0mm, while providing 59\u201377% overlap between images. The camera was looking with 45\u00b0 zenith angle in a compass direction perpendicular to the row direction to maximize the cross section viewed of the plants and minimize the effect of the wind created by the rotors. Agisoft photoscan software was then used to derive the position of the cameras for each image. Images were then projected on the ground surface to finally extract subsamples used to estimate the plant density. The extracted images were first classified to separate the green pixels from the background and the rows were then identified and extracted. Finally, image object (group of connected green pixels) was identified on each row and the number of plants they contain was estimated using a Support Vector Machine whose training was optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization. Three experiments were conducted in Gr\u00e9oux, Avignon and Clermont sites with some variability in the sowing dates, densities, genotypes, flight altitude, and growth stage at the time of the image acquisition. The application of the method on the 270 samples available over the three sites provides a RMSE and relative RMSE on estimates of 34.05 plants/m2 and 14.31% with a bias of 9.01 plants/m2. However, differences in performances were observed between the three sites, mostly related to the growth stage at the time of the flight. Plants should have between one to two leaves when images are taken. Further, a specific sensitivity analysis shows that the ground resolution of the images should be better than 0.40\u00a0mm. Finally, the repeatability of the method is good especially when images are taken from similar observational geometries. The current limits and possible improvements of the method proposed are finally discussed. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc."

In the present study, leaves extract of Canarium ovatum have been employed for the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (CO-AgNPs). CO-AgNPs were synthesised under very mild, eco-friendly manner where the plant extract acted both as reducing and capping agent These AgNPs were synthesised by taking into account several parameters, that included, time of reaction, concentration of AgNO3, amount of extract and temperature of reaction. The optimisation studies suggested efficient synthesis of CO-AgNPs at 25\u00b0C when 1.5 mM AgNO3 was reduced with 1:20 ratio of plant extract for 40 min. Size determination studies done on dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscope suggested of spherical shape nanoparticles of size 119.7 \u00b1 7 nm and 50-80 nm respectively. Further, characterisations were done by Fourier transform infrared and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to evaluate the functional groups and the purity of CO-AgNPs. The antibacterial efficacy of CO-AgNPs was determined against the bacterial strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As evident from disc diffusion method studies, CO-AgNPs remarkably inhibited the growth of the tested microorganism This study suggested that C. ovatum extract efficiently synthesises CO-AgNPs with significant antibacterial properties and can be good candidates for therapeutics. \u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016."

            "text": "Background: Recent advances in nanomedicine have shown the great interest of active targeting associated to nanoparticles. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) of disease-specific antibodies are very promising targeting entities because they are small, not immunogenic and able to bind their specific antigens. The present paper is devoted to biological properties in vitro and in vivo of fluorescent and pegylated iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs-Cy-PEG-scFv) functionalized with scFv targeting Human Epithelial growth Receptor 2 (HER2). Results: Thanks to a site-selective scFv conjugation, the resultant nanoprobes demonstrated high affinity and specific binding to HER2 breast cancer cells. The cellular uptake of SPIONs-Cy-PEG-scFv was threefold higher than that for untargeted PEGylated iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs-Cy-PEG) and is correlated to the expression of HER2 on cells. In vivo, the decrease of MR signals in HER2+ xenograft tumor is about 30% at 24h after the injection. Conclusions: These results all indicate that SPIONs-Cy-PEG-scFv are relevant tumor-targeting magnetic resonance imaging agents, suitable for diagnosis of HER2 overexpressing breast tumor. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

Clausena (Rutaceae) is a genus of about 23 species of unarmed trees and shrubs. The stem bark of C. dentata is used in veterinary medicine for the treatment of wounds and sprains. Even though C. dentata has a lot of potential medical uses, the study of pharmacological properties is very scarce. Methods: The plant C. dentata was collected in May 1999 from Kadagaman, near Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu, India, and authenticated by Centre for Advanced Study in Botany, University of Madras, Chennai. The dry powder of stem bark was extracted with hexane, chloroform, and methanol. The extracts were subjected to thin-layer chromatography and phytochemical screening. Further, the extracts were tested for analgesic by the tail flick and anti-inflammatory by carrageenan-induced rat paw edema using plethysmometer. Results: Qualitative chemical tests revealed the presence of various phytochemicals such as alkaloids, glycosides, carbohydrate, proteins and amino acids, phytosterols, and volatile oil. The hexane, chloroform, and methanol extracts exhibited significant analgesic activity as compared to control group (Tween 80, 1%). The anti-inflammatory activity of C. dentata extracts revealed that the percent inhibition of carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema was highly significant as compared to control group after 4 h of injection. Conclusion: The presence of coumarin and alkaloids all the extracts promising properties of analgesic and anti-inflammatory. \u00a9 2018 The Authors."

Two new universities were founded with botanical departments. Together with these, three universities conducted botanical education at that time. During the 50 years of the dualistic era, altogether 9 university professors were working in these departments together with teaching assistants. More and more private teachers participated in university education in the second half of the era. Private teachers usually were experts of a special field, and their activity promoted a differentiation in Hungarian botany. Education of botany played the most important role in the training of grammar school teachers, therefore most of the botanists graduated as natural history teachers. Education of botany was also practised in several other schools, i.e. special schools for agriculture, forestry, horticulture and veterinary medicine. The considerable improvement in the education of botany in these institutes during the dualistic era enabled the establishment of academies or high schools with independent botanical departments by the end of the era. In the last decades, botany was educated by graduated botanists also in these schools, however, only a few students participated in research of the flora of Hungary. Due to the botanical education in the governmental teachers' training system established during the dualistic era, a number of its teachers and their students (i.e. the primary school teachers) could participate in the floristic exploration of Hungary. The number of professional botanists considerably increased during the dualistic era in Hungary, more and more graduated botanists were working in educational, scientific and cultural institutes. Although only 3-5 professional botanists were working in Hungary at the beginning of the era, this number increased to 40-50 by the end of the era. \u00a9 2018 Magyar Biologiai Tarsasag (Hungarian Biological Society).

            "text": "                             Maintaining urban greenspace results in energy use and GHG emissions. To understand the change of the annual maintenance energy consumption and GHG emissions in varying combinations of plant structures (plant density or proportion of area covered) in urban greenspace, this study investigated 34 urban plant communities as sample plots (20\u00d720 m), and divided them into woodland, shrub, herbaceous and grassland layers. The average energy use and GHG emissions in the woodland layer were 18.64 MJ/tree/y                             \u20131                              and 0.23 kg/CO                             2                             -e/tree/y                             \u20131                             , respectively. In the shrub, herbaceous, and grassland layers, the average energy consumption was 3.73, 2.27, 7.23 MJ/m                             2                             /y                             \u20131                             , and the average GHG emissions were 0.06, 0.02, 0.09 kg/CO                             2                             -e/m                             2                             /y                             \u20131                             , respectively. The energy use and GHG emission curves had parabolic trends as the plant density in the woodland layer increased and increasing curves with two peaks as the plant area proportions of the shrub, herbaceous, and grassland layers increased. The annual maintenance of urban greenspace can divide into low, average and high levels of energy consumption and GHG emissions due to the change in the plant structure combinations. Furthermore, city managers and landscape designers can refer to the energy consumption and GHG emissions trends to understand the environmental impact of maintenance tasks. The future plant structures in greenspace can be better designed to improve ecosystem services based on limiting the maintenance environmental impacts.                          \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

            "text": "The kernel setting of maize varies greatly because of the timing and intensity of water deficits. This variation can limit leaf productivity (source), the translocation of assimilated sugars (flow), and yield formation (sink). To explain the decline in kernel setting of maize under water deficits from the perspective of source-flow-sink, a 3-year experiment was conducted under a rain shelter. Five water regimes were studied. One regime included well-irrigated (CK) treatment. Four regimes involved water deficits: irrigation was withheld during the 6- to 8-leaf stage (V6\u22128), the 9- to 12-leaf stage (V9\u221212), the 13-leaf stage to tasseling stage (V13\u2212T), and the silking stage to blister stage (R1\u22122). Water deficit effects on kernel setting began when the water deficit occurred at V9 and became more significant with time. Kernel weight was reduced by 12 and 11% when there were water deficits during V9\u221212 and V13\u2212T, respectively. This was the result of reduced leaf area (limited source) and an altered vascular bundle in the ear peduncles (limited assimilate flow). The reduced vascular bundle number, rather than the ear peduncle cross-sectional area, significantly affected the final kernel weight when exposed to a water deficit prior to the silking stage. The water deficits prior to and close to the flowering stage significantly reduced ear kernel number; that is, 14 and 19% less during V13\u2212T and R1\u22122, respectively, compared with the kernel number during the CK treatment. This reflects a smaller sink under water deficit conditions. Additionally, ovary size was reduced the most in the V13\u2212T water deficit compared with other treatments. After rewatering, the water deficit before or during flowering stage continued to have residual effects on grain-filling in the late growth period. The grain-filling rate decreased under the V9\u221212 water deficit; the grain-filling duration shortened under the R1\u22122 water deficit; and both negative effects occurred under the V13\u2212T water deficit. This study clearly indicated that (1) the water deficit during the vegetative organ rapid growth period both limited leaf source development and assimilate flow and slowed down kernel development, and (2) the water deficit just before and during flowering reduced kernel sink. Deficits at both times could retard grain-filling and reduce maize yield. The results of the present study might guide irrigation practices in irrigated maize or inform the management of sowing time in rainfed maize, to desynchronize the water deficit and the plant\u2019s reactions to such deficits at different stages. \u00a9 2018 Li, Tao, Zhang, Huang and Wang."

Compared with WPI, WPI-SY had a less particle size at pH 3.5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 from 0 to 6 days. Fluorescence intensity of WPI-SY complexes was appreciably less than WPI, which indicated that the partial tyrosine or tryptophan residues of whey protein had undergone certain changes. Compared with WPI and SY, thermal stability and emulsifying activity of WPI-SY complexes remarkably increased at different pH values. Meanwhile, antioxidant activities of WPI-SY complexes were higher than that of WPI or SY at pH ranged 4.5 to 9.5, kept for 3 and 6 d. Therefore, the interaction of WPI and SY at different pH values, could improve emulsifying activity of WPI and enhance antioxidant activity of SY.

For this purpose, the effect of combined eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 50 mg/kg/day) modulating hepatic lipid metabolism and hydroxytyrosol (HT; 5 mg/kg/day) exerting antioxidant actions was evaluated on hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress induced by a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrates) compared to a control diet (CD; 10% fat, 20% protein, and 70% carbohydrates) in mice fed for 12 weeks. HFD-induced liver steatosis (i) was reduced by 32% by EPA, without changes in oxidative stress-related parameters and mild recovery of Nrf2 functioning affording antioxidation and (ii) was decreased by 42% by HT, concomitantly with total regain of the glutathione status diminished by HFD, 42% to 59% recovery of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation enhanced by HFD, and regain of Nrf2 functioning, whereas (iii) combined EPA +HT supplementation elicited 74% reduction in liver steatosis, with total recovery of the antioxidant potential in a similar manner than HT. It is concluded that combined HT+ EPA drastically decreases NAFLD development, an effect that shows additivity in HT and EPA effects that mainly relies on HT, strengthening the impact of oxidative stress as a central mechanism underlying liver steatosis in obesity.

The results revealed that the pharmacokinetic behaviors could be changed in NAFLD mice compared with control mice. The area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentrations of IhD and IsA were greatly decreased in the NAFLD mice. However, the main residence time of ID and IA were greatly increased in the NAFLD mice.

According to the 2014 government of Pakistan (GOP) survey, Pakistan had 171 million head of cattle that would produce 345 billion kg of manure, which could easily be converted into 150 billion m3 of biogas. The focus of the present study was to evaluate the benefits from co-digestion of cattle manure (CM) with Dalbergia sissoo leaves (DSL) and Malus domestica leaves (MDL), with a focus on changes in the biodegradability, C/N ratio effect, and synergistic effect. The idea was to adjust the C/N ratio to increase biodegradability at mesophilic range to help the process to produce more methane than 100% manure-based digestion. First, the ideal pH and temperature conditions for mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) were optimized to carry out further co-digestion under the same conditions. The results of co-digestion revealed a 40% (251 NmL CH4/g VS) increase in methane yield by replacing 20% of volatile solid in CM-based AD reactors with MDL. This combination also presented a biodegradability of 59% and a synergistic effect (\u03b8) value of 1.40, which corresponded to highly positive synergism reflecting the optimum growth conditions. The DSL/CM co-digestion also followed the same pattern, and the maximum methane yield of 229 NmL CH4/g VS was obtained using a 20/80 DSL/CM combination. \u00a9 2018 North Carolina State University."

This study investigated how the summer- (August) and autumn-, especially late autumn (mid-September to mid-October) plantings affect the field performance of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) container seedlings. This study examined the timing of root growth just after planting, shoot flush and the start of root growth the following spring, and subsequent field performance. Seedlings of both species were planted in a nursery field trial, and in a clearcut reforestation site from August to October and the following May. The root growth of planted seedlings declined in September and ceased after mid-September. In the following spring, seedlings which were planted in early-autumn started their root growth faster than late-autumn-planted seedlings in both species. There was no difference in the timing of shoot flush for various planting dates. During the initial two years after planting, the shoot growth of spring-planted seedlings was lower, compared to autumn-planted seedlings. In conclusion, it is possible to plant conifer seedlings in the boreal forest zone up to October under non-limiting field conditions. \u00a9 2018, Finnish Society of Forest Science.

To date, only a few studies have assessed the usability of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets in this context. Here we present an analysis of an unprecedented set of C-band observations of mixed temperate forests. We demonstrate the potential of using multitemporal C-band VV and VH polarisation data for monitoring phenology and classifying forests in northern Switzerland. Each SAR acquisition was first radiometrically terrain corrected using digital elevation model-based image simulations of the local illuminated area. The flattened backscatter values and the local area values were input to a temporal compositing process integrating backscatter values from ascending and descending tracks. The process used local resolution weighting of each input, producing composite backscatter values that strongly mitigated terrain-induced distortions. Several descriptors were calculated to show the seasonal variation of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus robur, Quercus petraea) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) in C-band data. Using their distinct seasonal signatures, the timing of leaf emergence and leaf fall of the deciduous species were estimated and compared to available ground observations. Furthermore, classifications for the forest types 'deciduous' and 'coniferous' and the investigated species were implemented using random forest classifiers. The deciduous species backscatter was about 1 dB higher than spruce throughout the year in both polarisations. The forest types showed opposing seasonal backscatter behaviours. At VH, deciduous species showed higher backscatter in winter than in summer, whereas spruce showed higher backscatter in summer than in winter. In VV, this pattern was similar for spruce, while no distinct seasonal behaviour was apparent for the deciduous species. The time differences between the estimations and the ground observations of the phenological events were approximately within the error margin (\u00b112 days) of the temporal resolution. The classification performances were promising, with higher accuracies achieved for the forest types (OA of 86% and k = 0.73) than for individual species (OA of 72% and k = 0.58). These results show that multitemporal C-band backscatter data have significant potential to supplement optical remote sensing data for ecological studies and mapping of mixed temperate forests."

Final yields of extraction and physical properties of extracted EOs did not show any significant difference among the three methods, but the required extraction time for extraction by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE; i.e., MAHD and SFME) methods improved to a shorter time span. Even though the compounds in all three extraction techniques were exactly similar, extraction by MAE methods, especially the SFME, increased the quantity of oxygenated compounds such as citral isomers (geranial and neral) in comparison with HD. The obtained results showed that MAE methods, especially SFME, can selectively extract oxygenated compounds such as citral isomers and improve antioxidant and antifungal activities of the extracted EOs. Practical applications: Oxygenated compounds like citral isomers are mostly effective in treating many health disorders. According to the results of this study, microwave extraction like MAHD and SFME result in the enrichment of citral isomers of EOs. This selective extraction can affect antioxidant and antifungal activities of EOs extracted by the microwave method in comparison with conventional methods like HD. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Hollow microneedles allow for precise and non-invasive intradermal delivery of vaccines. In this study, ovalbumin (OVA)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with and without TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) were prepared and administered intradermally by hollow microneedles. The capacity of the PLGA nanoparticles to induce a cytotoxic T cell response, contributing to protection against intracellular pathogens, was examined. We show that a single injection of OVA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles, compared to soluble OVA, primed both adoptively transferred antigen-specific na\u00efve transgenic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with markedly high efficiency. Applying a triple immunization protocol, PLGA nanoparticles primed also endogenous OVA-specific CD8+ T cells. Immune response, following immunization with in particular anionic PLGA nanoparticles co-encapsulated with OVA and poly(I:C), provided protection against a recombinant strain of the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, secreting OVA. Taken together, we show that PLGA nanoparticle formulation is an excellent delivery system for protein antigen into the skin and that protective cellular immune responses can be induced using hollow microneedles for intradermal immunizations. \u00a9 2017"

The chemical composition, elemental composition, and heating values were close to those of switchgrass except for a higher cellulose content. All varieties scored higher than 110, suggesting excellent potential as an energy crop. Pretreatment resulted in almost complete hydrolysis and achieved a higher glucose yield. In particular, E33 and E19 yielded 337.4 g and 332.4 g glucose, respectively, from 1.0 kg of feedstock compared with 312.1g/kg for switchgrass. E33, E49, and E19 exhibited a higher ethanol yield of 144.2 g/kg, 146.9 g/kg, and 149.6 g/kg feedstock, respectively, at a solids loading of 15%. No obvious influences could be observed on anaerobic digestion performances. A 16.3%, 14.6%, 14.0%, and 13.1% higher yield on cumulative methane could be obtained from E17, E23, E33, and E6, respectively, compared to switchgrass. Bioethanol and biomethane could be maximally obtained from E19 (6820 kg/ha) and E17 (3916 m3/ha), respectively. Thus, they are specially recommended for bioethanol and biomethane production, respectively. E33 can be suggested as a flexible variety for yielding relatively high bioethanol (6008 kg/ha) and biomethane (3409 m3/ha)."

            "text": "The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is a proxy for light use efficiency (LUE), and is used in remote sensing to measure plant stress and photosynthetic downregulation in plant canopies. It is known to depend on local light conditions within a canopy indicating non-photosynthetic quenching of incident radiation. Additionally, when measured from a distance, canopy PRI depends on shadow fraction-the fraction of shaded foliage in the instantaneous field of view of the sensor-due to observation geometry. Our aim is to quantify the extent to which sunlit fraction alone can describe variations in PRI so that it would be possible to correct for its variation and identify other possible factors affecting the PRI-sunlit fraction relationship. We used a high spatial and spectral resolution Aisa Eagle airborne imaging spectrometer above a boreal Scots pine site in Finland (Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 forest research station, 61\u00b0500N, 24\u00b0170E), with the sensor looking in nadir and tilted (off-nadir) directions. The spectral resolution of the data was 4.6 nm, and the spatial resolution was 0.6 m. We compared the PRI for three different scatter angles (\u03b2 = 19\u00b0, 55\u00b0 and 76\u00b0, defined as the angle between sensor and solar directions) at the forest stand level, and observed a small (0.006) but statistically significant (p < 0.01) difference in stand PRI.We found that stand mean PRI was not a direct function of sunlit fraction. However, for each scatter angle separately, we found a clear non-linear relationship between PRI and sunlit fraction. The relationship was systematic and had a similar shape for all of the scatter angles. As the PRI-sunlit fraction curves for the different scatter angles were shifted with respect to each other, no universal curve could be found causing the observed independence of canopy PRI from the average sunlit fraction of each view direction. We found the shifts of the curves to be related to a leaf structural effect on canopy scattering: the ratio of needle spectral reflectance to transmittance. We demonstrate that modeling PRI-sunlit fraction relationships using high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy data is suitable and needed in order to quantify PRI variations over forest canopies. \u00a9 2017 by the authors."

            "text": "An important goal for improving vaccine and immunotherapy technologies is the ability to provide further control over the specific phenotypes of T cells arising from these agents. Along these lines, frequent administration of rapamycin (Rapa), a small molecule inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), exhibits a striking ability to polarize T cells toward central memory phenotypes (TCM), or to suppress immune function, depending on the concentrations and other signals present during administration. TCM exhibit greater plasticity and proliferative capacity than effector memory T cells (TEFF) and, therefore, polarizing vaccine-induced T cells toward TCM is an intriguing strategy to enhance T cell expansion and function against pathogens or tumors. Here we combined biodegradable microparticles encapsulating Rapa (Rapa MPs) with vaccines composed of soluble peptide antigens and molecular adjuvants to test if this approach allows polarization of differentiating T cells toward TCM. We show Rapa MPs modulate DC function, enhancing secretion of inflammatory cytokines at very low doses, and suppressing function at high doses. While Rapa MP treatment reduced \u2013 but did not stop \u2013 T cell proliferation in both CD4+ and CD8+ transgenic T cell co-cultures, the expanding CD8+ T cells differentiated to higher frequencies of TCM at low doses of MP Rapa MPs. Lastly, we show in mice that local delivery of Rapa MPs to lymph nodes during vaccination either suppresses or enhances T cell function in response to melanoma antigens, depending on the dose of drug in the depots. In particular, at low Rapa MP doses, vaccines increased antigen-specific TCM, resulting in enhanced T cell expansion measured during subsequent booster injections over at least 100 days. \u00a9 2017 The Authors"

The total lipid content of cactus pear flower was about 2% with the neutral lipid amount, especially monoacylglycerols, being the highest. The lipids were rich in linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acids. The essential oil yield was 0.01% with the presence of 29 components in a complex mixture of monoterpenes. The main components of the essential oil were benzenacetatealdehyde, D-3-carene, hexanol, and \u03b1-pinene. Solvents with different polarities had significant effect on polyphenol contents and antioxidant activity of cactus pear flower. RP-HPLC analysis allowed characterization of 20 phenolic compounds mainly belonging to phenolic acid and flavonoid classes. Based on its phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity, cactus pear flower could be used in food, industrial, and biomedical applications. Practical applications: The interest in naturally occurring antioxidants has recently increased for use in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products to replace synthetic antioxidants, which are being restricted because of their carcinogenicity. The cactus pear flower constitutes one of the by-products in cactus industry and generally discarded by separation from the fruit. This study aimed to valorize cactus pear flower through its lipids, essential oils, phenolics, and antioxidant activity. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

A dramatic upsurge in botanical metaphors for poetic collections around 1800 was triggered by shifts in the geographies, aims, and representational practices of botany in the previous century. Yoking Linnaean taxonomy and Buffonian vitalism to Hogarth's line of beauty, late eighteenth-century botanical illustrations imbued plucked, pressed specimens with a new vitality. Erasmus Darwin's Botanic Garden (1789, 1791) translated the aesthetic reanimations of visual art into a collection of poetic specimens, spurring compilations that promote a vitalist standard of literary value. By rejecting aesthetic reanimation as the figurative ground for poetic collecting, Charlotte Smith and Robert Southey forward an alternative historical model of literary merit, one grounded in the succession and continuity of representative literary types. These competing metrics for selection and valuation underwrite the anthology as we know it today. \u00a9 The Regents of the University of California."

However, direct evidence for the processes driving the NP uptake and distribution in plants is scarce at the cellular level. Here, NP-root interactions were investigated after 10 days of exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana to 10 mg\u00b7L-1 of negatively or positively charged gold NPs (\u223c12 nm) in gels. Two complementary imaging tools were used: X-ray computed nanotomography (nano-CT) and enhanced dark-field microscopy combined with hyperspectral imaging (DF-HSI). The use of these emerging techniques improved our ability to detect and visualize NP in plant tissue: by spectral confirmation via DF-HSI, and in three dimensions via nano-CT. The resulting imaging provides direct evidence that detaching border-like cells (i.e., sheets of border cells detaching from the root) and associated mucilage can accumulate and trap NPs irrespective of particle charge. On the contrary, border cells on the root cap behaved in a charge-specific fashion: positively charged NPs induced a higher mucilage production and adsorbed to it, which prevented translocation into the root tissue. Negatively charged NPs did not adsorb to the mucilage and were able to translocate into the apoplast. These observations provide direct mechanistic insight into NP-plant interactions, and reveal the important function of border cells and mucilage in interactions of plants with charged NPs. \u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society."

In extant plant systems microbes still remain an integral part of the ecological landscape, impacting plant health, productivity and long-term fitness. Therefore, to properly understand the genetic wiring of plants, we must first determine what perception systems plants have evolved to parse beneficial from commensal from pathogenic microbes. In this review, we consider some of the most recent advances in how plants respond at the molecular level to different microbial lifestyles. Further, we cover some of the means by which microbes are able to manipulate plant signaling pathways through altered destructiveness and nutrient sinks, as well as the use of effector proteins and micro-RNAs (miRNAs). We conclude by highlighting some of the major questions still to be answered in the field of plant-microbe research, and suggest some of the key areas that are in greatest need of further research investment. The results of these proposed studies will have impacts in a wide range of plant research disciplines and will, ultimately, translate into stronger agronomic crops and forestry stock, with immune perception and response systems bred to foster beneficial microbial symbioses while repudiating pathogenic symbioses. \u00a9 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Abstract: Douglas-fir is a conifer species with high and increasing interest for forest industries in both New Zealand and France. Delivery of the best trees to the forest from breeding programmes is currently constrained by an inability to effectively and reliably multiply selections through vegetative propagation. Somatic embryogenesis coupled with cryopreservation is essential biotechnology tool in conifers for scaling up variety design and production. The aim of this work was therefore to develop protocols for the initiation and proliferation of Douglas-fir embryogenic cell lines based on the modifications of previously published techniques and media available in the public domain, especially successful methods developed for P. radiata at Scion. Three years of initiation experiments have resulted in a simple and efficient protocol. Disinfection of whole cones (instead of seeds) was sufficient to prevent contamination. Immature zygotic embryos were excised from megagametophytes and placed onto a modified Litvay medium (Plant Cell Rep 4(6):325\u2013328, 1985). At optimal development stages of zygotic embryos, the average initiation percentage of embryogenic tissue was 69.3% when our most effective protocol was used. Proliferation of initiated cell lines on a Glitz formulation was challenging, with a high percentage of cell lines composed of a mixture of both embryonal masses and callus. 2,4-D at a lower concentration reduced the number of such mixed lines. Repeated liquid suspension and subculture of the embryogenic parts of the tissue was an efficient means to increase the number of embryogenic cell lines with sustained proliferation. Maltose added to the proliferation medium in place of sucrose improved fresh mass gain and consistently increased early somatic embryo patterning and growth. A sample of proliferating cell lines was successfully cryopreserved, thawed and somatic embryos were matured and germinated from these lines. The method may be of practical interest and provide new opportunities to realize increased genetic gain in this species through the clonal-assisted deployment of the best genetic material in both New Zealand and France. \u00a9 2017, The Author(s)."

The B- and G-genomes of polyploid wheat are also the derivatives of the S-genome. Evolution of the S-genome species was studied using Giemsa C-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes representing 5S (pTa794) and 18S-5.8S-26S (pTa71) rDNAs as well as nine tandem repeats: pSc119.2, pAesp_SAT86, Spelt-1, Spelt-52, pAs1, pTa-535, and pTa-s53. To correlate the C-banding and FISH patterns we used the microsatellites (CTT)10 and (GTT)9, which are major components of the C-banding positive heterochromatin in wheat. According to the results obtained, diploid species split into two groups corresponding to Emarginata and Truncata sub-sections, which differ in the C-banding patterns, distribution of rDNA and other repeats. The B- and G-genomes of polyploid wheat are most closely related to the S-genome of Ae. speltoides. The genomes of allopolyploid wheat have been evolved as a result of different species-specific chromosome translocations, sequence amplification, elimination and re-patterning of repetitive DNA sequences. These events occurred independently in different wheat species and in Ae. speltoides. The 5S rDNA locus of chromosome 1S was probably lost in ancient Ae. speltoides prior to formation of Timopheevii wheat, but after the emergence of ancient emmer. Evolution of Emarginata species was associated with an increase of C-banding and (CTT)10-positive heterochromatin, amplification of Spelt-52, re-pattering of the pAesp_SAT86, and a gradual decrease in the amount of the D-genome-specific repeats pAs1, pTa-535, and pTa-s53. The emergence of Ae. peregrina and Ae. kotschyi did not lead to significant changes of the S*-genomes. However, partial elimination of 45S rDNA repeats from 5S* and 6S* chromosomes and alterations of C-banding and FISH-patterns have been detected. Similarity of the Sv-genome of Ae. vavilovii with the Ss genome of diploid Ae. searsii confirmed the origin of this hexaploid. A model of the S-genome evolution is suggested. \u00a9 2018 Ruban and Badaeva."

The present work aimed to investigate how different pre-UV-B-exposures can modulate the phenolic response of peach fruit infected with Monilinia fructicola. Through HPLC-DAD-MSn, several procyanidins, phenolic acids, flavonols, and anthocyanins were detected. Both UV-B radiation and fungal infection were able to stimulate the accumulation of phenolics, dependent on the chemical structure. Regarding UV-B exposure, inoculated with sterile water, 3 h of UV-B radiation highest concentration of phenolics was found, especially flavonols and cyanidin-3-glucoside far from the wound. However, wounding decreased the phenolics in the region nearby. When peaches were pre-treated with 1 h of UV-B radiation, the fungus had an additive effect in phenolic accumulation far from the infection, while it had a subtractive effect with 3 h of UV-B radiation, especially for flavonols. Canonical discriminant analysis and Pearson correlation revealed that all phenolic compounds, except procyanidin dimer, were highly regulated by UV-B radiation, with particularly strong correlation for quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, while phenolics correlated with the fungus infection were quercetin-3-galactoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, kaempferol-3-galactoside and isorhamnetin-3-glucoside. Modulation of pathogen-induced phenolics also far from inoculation site might suggest a migration of signaling molecules from the infected area to healthy tissues. \u00a9 2018 Santin, Neugart, Castagna, Barilari, Sarrocco, Vannacci, Schreiner and Ranieri."

Here, we test the hypothesis that treatment with ASM can protect apple (Malus \u00d7 domestica) against the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea) and investigate the defense molecules potentially involved in resistance. We measured aphid life traits and performed behavioral assays to study the effect of ASM on plant resistance against the aphid, and then combined transcriptomic, bioinformatics, metabolic and biochemical analyses to identify the plant compounds involved in resistance. Plants treated with ASM negatively affected several life traits of the aphid and modified its feeding and host seeking behaviors. ASM treatment elicited up-regulation of terpene synthase genes in apple and led to the emission of (E,E)-\u03b1-farnesene, a sesquiterpene that was repellent to the aphid. Several genes encoding amaranthin-like lectins were also strongly up-regulated upon treatment and the corresponding proteins accumulated in leaves, petioles and stems. Our results link the production of specific apple proteins and metabolites to the antibiosis and antixenosis effects observed against Dysaphis plantaginea, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying ASM-induced herbivore resistance. \u00a9 2018 Warneys, Gaucher, Robert, Aligon, Anton, Aubourg, Barthes, Braud, Cournol, Gadenne, Heintz, Brisset and Degrave."

For this process, plants contain versatile and multifaceted photoreceptor systems to sense variations in the light spectrum and to acclimate to a range of ambient conditions. Five main groups of photoreceptors have been found in higher plants, cryptochromes, phototropins, UVR8, zeitlupes, and phytochromes, but the last one red/far red wavelengths photoreceptor is the most characterized. Among the many responses modulated by phytochromes, these molecules play an important role in biotic and abiotic stress responses, which is one of the most active research topics in plant biology, especially their effect on agronomic traits. However, regarding the light spectrum, it is not surprising to consider that other photoreceptors are also part of the stress response modulated by light. In fact, it has become increasingly evident that cryptochromes, which mainly absorb in the blue light region, also act as key regulators of a range of plant stress responses, such as drought, salinity, heat, and high radiation. However, this information is rarely evidenced in photomorphogenetic studies. Therefore, the scope of the present review is to compile and discuss the evidence on the abiotic stress responses in plants that are modulated by cryptochromes. \u00a9 2018 D\u2019Amico-Dami\u00e3o and Carvalho."

This sesquiterpenoid is specifically produced in Chinese traditional herbal plant Artemisia annua. Earlier studies have shown that phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in increasing the artemisinin content, but how ABA regulates artemisinin biosynthesis is still poorly understood. In this study, we identified that AaABF3 encoded an ABRE (ABA-responsive elements) binding factor. qRT-PCR analysis showed that AaABF3 was induced by ABA and expressed much higher in trichomes where artemisinin is synthesized and accumulated. To further investigate the mechanism of AaABF3 regulating the artemisinin biosynthesis, we carried out dual-luciferase analysis, yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results revealed that AaABF3 could directly bind to the promoter of ALDH1 gene, which is a key gene in artemisinin biosynthesis, and activate the expression of ALDH1. Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of AaABF3 in A. annua enhanced the production of artemisinin, while RNA interference of AaABF3 resulted in decreased artemisinin content. Taken together, our results demonstrated that AaABF3 played an important role in ABA-regulated artemisinin biosynthesis through direct regulation of artemisinin biosynthesis gene, ALDH1. \u00a9 2018 Zhong, Li, Hao, Fu, Ma, Xie, Shen, Kayani, Pan, Sun and Tang."

Firstly, the spectral reflectance of 355 samples was collected by hyperspectral camera and the leaves water content was measured by weighing method. Secondly, the average reflectance of the whole leaves was extracted, and the sensitive wavelengths of leaf water content were screened respectively by correlation analysis (CA) and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS). The results were as follows: the 15 sensitive wavelengths located in the range of 1400-1450 nm were selected by CA method. While, there were 13 sensitive wavelengths selected by the CARS algorithm including 976.4 nm, 1037.7 nm, 1044.5 nm, 1061.4 nm, 1108.7 nm, 1139 nm, 1357.8 nm, 1380.7 nm, 1397 nm, 1432.8 nm, 1452.3 nm, 1513.6 nm and 1520.0 nm. Finally, after compared the partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling results of the water content detection based on two group sensitive wavelengths. The CARS-PLSR was elected to detect the water content of potato leaves. The modeling calibration accuracy of CARS-PLSR was 0.9878, and the validation accuracy coefficient was 0.9366. It provides a new theoretical method for detecting water content of potato plant in the field. \u00a9 2018"

In this study, we simulated stand development and carbon pools in four even-aged stands representing the two most common tree species in Fennoscandia, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), growing on high- and low-productivity sites. We hypothesized that increased rotation lengths (+10, +20, and +30 years) in comparison with today\u2019s practice would increase forests\u2019 average carbon stock during a rotation cycle but decrease the average yield. The results showed that for spruce, a moderate increase in rotation length (+10 years) increased both average standing carbon stock and average yield. For the longer alternatives (+20 and +30 years) for spruce and for all pine alternatives, prolonging rotation lengths resulted in increased average standing carbon stocks but decreased average yield, resulting in decreased carbon storage in forest products and decreased substitution effects. Decreasing the rotation lengths (\u221210 years) always resulted in both decreased average standing carbon stocks and decreased yields. We conclude that a moderate increase of rotation lengths may slightly increase forests\u2019 climate benefits for spruce sites, but for all other alternatives, there was a trade-off between the temporary gain of increasing carbon stocks and the permanent loss in productivity and, consequently, substitution potential. \u00a9 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

Pretreatment with PHP suppressed the generations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), prevented a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH), and up-regulated the activities of cellular antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, PHP treatment stimulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of antioxidant enzymes and nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). Meanwhile, PHP markedly reduced the level of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), suggesting that PHP effectively activated Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated activity.

This study investigates tensile strength, Young's modulus, and root diameter relationships for establishing woody perennials. Methods Specimens of ten woody European shrubs and small trees were transplanted into sandy loam soil to establish for six months. Root tensile strength and Young's modulus were measured as well as the root length-diameter distribution. The effect of root water status on root diameter was evaluated for Scotch Broom. Results More than half of the root length for all species was thinner than 0.5 mm diameter. Typical tensile strengths were <40 MPa, with Young's modulus <600 MPa. Negative power relationships between root strength and root diameter existed only for Gorse and Spindle, whilst Blackthorn, European Box and Holly showed slight increase in tensile strength with diameter. Hawthorn, Hazel and Privet showed rapid initial increase in strength with diameter followed by strength decrease with diameter, post-peak. Young's modulus was linearly related to tensile strength for all ten species (P < 0.001; R2 values 17%\u201364%). Root diameter, investigated for Scotch Broom, depended strongly on root water potential and root water content by mass. Root water content could influence considerably the calculations of tensile strength. Discussion and conclusion Root tensile strength-diameter relationships often do not follow a negative power law, and depends strongly on taxa. Young's modulus was strongly related to tensile strength of roots for certain species. Water status of roots strongly influences root diameter and hence strength and Young's modulus properties, and must be controlled carefully in experiments. \u00a9 2017"

            "text": "Plant roots can be very effective in stabilizing the soil against concentrated flow erosion. So far, most research on the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots was conducted on loamy soils. However susceptible to incisive erosion processes, at present, no research exists on the effectiveness of plant roots in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates in sandy soils. Therefore, the prime objective of this study was to assess the erosion-reducing potential of both fibrous and tap roots in sandy soils. Furthermore, we investigated potential effects of root diameter, soil texture and dry soil bulk density on the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots. Therefore, flume experiments conducted on sandy soils (this study) were compared with those on sandy loam and silt loam soils (using the same experimental set up). Results showed that plant roots were very efficient in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates in sandy soils compared to root-free bare soils. Furthermore, our results confirmed that fibrous roots were more effective compared to (thick) tap roots. Dry soil bulk density and soil texture also played a significant role. As they were both related to soil cohesion, the results of this study suggested that the effectiveness of plant roots in controlling concentrated flow erosion rates depended on the apparent soil cohesion. The nature of this soil type effect depended on the root-system type: fine root systems were most effective in non-cohesive soils while tap root systems were most effective in cohesive soils. For soils permeated with a given amount of fibrous roots, an increase of soil bulk density seemed to hamper the effectiveness of roots to further increase soil cohesion and reduce erosion rates. In soils reinforced by tap root systems, the erosion-reducing power of the roots depended on sand content: the higher the percentage of sand, the smaller the erosion-reducing effect for a given amount of roots. This was attributed to more pronounced vortex erosion around the thicker tap roots in non-cohesive soils, increasing soil erosion rates. The results presented in this study could support practitioners to assess the likely erosion-reducing effects of plant root systems based on both root and soil characteristics. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V."

While these plant-mediated indirect competitive interactions are well described, and the co-existence of herbivores from different feeding guilds is common, the mechanisms of co-existence are poorly understood. In both field and glasshouse experiments with a native tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, we found no evidence of negative interactions when plants were simultaneously attacked by two spatially separated herbivores: a leaf chewer Manduca sexta and a stem borer Trichobaris mucorea. T.\u00a0mucorea attack elicited jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine bursts in the pith of attacked stems similar to those that occur in leaves when M. sexta attacks N. attenuata leaves. Pith chlorogenic acid (CGA) levels increased 1000-fold to levels 6-fold higher than leaf levels after T.\u00a0mucorea attack; these increases in pith CGA levels, which did not occur in M.\u00a0sexta-attacked leaves, required JA signaling. With plants silenced in CGA biosynthesis (irHQT plants), CGA, as well as other caffeic acid conjugates, was demonstrated in both glasshouse and field experiments to function as a direct defense protecting piths against T.\u00a0mucorea attack, but not against leaf chewers or sucking insects. T.\u00a0mucorea attack does not systemically activate JA signaling in leaves, while M.\u00a0sexta leaf-attack transiently induces detectable but minor pith JA levels that are dwarfed by local responses. We conclude that tissue-localized defense responses allow tissue-specialized herbivores to share the same host and occupy different chemical defense niches in the same hostplant. \u00a9 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Given their widespread industrial use, a search for alternative sources of SAPs is a priority. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd) is a valuable food source that is gaining importance worldwide for its nutritional and nutraceutical properties. SAPs from quinoa seed coats could represent a new sustainable source to obtain these compounds in high quantities due to the increasing production and worldwide expansion of the crop. This research aims to characterise saponins of seed coat waste products from six different quinoa varieties for their potential use as a saponin source. Gas chromatography (GC)- and Liquid chromatography (LC)- with mass spectrometry (MS) were applied for qualitative and relative quantitative analysis of saponins. GC\u2013MS led to the identification of three main aglycones, oleanolic acid (Ole), hederagenin (Hed), and a phytolaccagenic acid (Phy), while LC\u2013MS enabled characterization of 24 SAPs with varying sugar moieties. Hed was the most abundant aglycone, followed by Phy and Oledepending on the genotype. Saponin distribution and relative abundances are discussed in the light of genotype provenance and agronomic features. Improved knowledge on the phytochemicals present in quinoa varieties might help in finding valuable and sustainable uses for quinoa SAPs in agroindustry as biopesticides as well as in the production of food and pharmaceuticals. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V."

The present study shows that a distinct selectivity for the two isomers occurs in the DEA reactions. Several new decay channels are observed for 2-nitroimidazole, including a dominant one leading to the loss of molecular H2O by attachment of a low-energy electron. In contrast, the loss of a single hydrogen atom is a much more efficient reaction in DEA to 4(5)-nitroimidazole. Quantum chemical calculations were carried out to explain the pronounced isomer effect found in the DEA experiment. Although the free energies of the reactions are similar for the different isomers, the very different natures of the dipole-bound states and valence-bound anions lead to preference for or hindrance of a particular dissociation channel. Nitroimidazolic compounds are considered as radiosensitizing compounds in tumor radiation therapy. The enhanced formation of fragments, including the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, in DEA to 2-nitroimidazole suggests that it may be a more efficient radiosensitizing agent than 4(5)-nitroimidazoles. \u00a9 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The total dietary fibre and arabinoxylan content significantly (p < 0.05) increased after the extrusion process while a significant decrease of all tocopherol isoforms was also observed. Catechin, caffeic, kaempferol and quercetin derivatives were identified in the raw and extruded lentil flours. The decreases of total phenolic and individual phenolic compounds were directly related to the extrusion temperature; total phenolics and catechin hexoside exhibited a larger decrease in the lentil flours formulated with higher content of nutritional yeast (12 and 16%).

For this reason, plantation for leaf production should be established separately from fruit production to obtain quality products. The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of the production of the bay laurel plant such as field crops in a shrub form. It is also important to know the ontogenetic variability on the amount of active substance and determine suitable plant density and appropriate harvesting time in order to increase leaf yield and essential oil with desired quality characteristics. Three different planting frequencies (1x1.5m; 1x3 m; 1x1x3 m) and three different harvesting times (one form per year, two forms per year and two years per form) were applied to the experiment. The experiment was established with a total of 1080 seedlings. In the experiment, the shoot length (16,84-31,50 cm), number of shoots (4,77-16,00 plants/plant), fresh weight (6,88-27,80 kg/da), dry weight (4,15-26,63 kg/da), dry leaf yield (2,57-17,29 kg/da), leaf area (20,41-24,56 cm2), chlorophyll SPAD value (32,36-39,5 kg/da), total ash content (7,96-11,46 %), essential oil content (2,06-3,12%) and essential oil yields were determined. \u00a9 2018, Inst.

However, the rate at which the climate is changing might exceed the rate of adaptation through evolutionary processes in long-lived plants. Persistence may depend on phenotypic plasticity in morphology and physiology. Here we investigated patterns of leaf trait variation including leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nutrients (C, N, P) and isotopes (\u03b413C and \u03b415N) across an elevation gradient on Gongga Mountain, Sichuan Province, China. We quantified inter- and intra-specific trait variation and the plasticity in leaf traits of selected species to experimental warming and cooling by using a reciprocal transplantation approach. We found substantial phenotypic plasticity in most functional traits where \u03b415N, leaf area, and leaf P showed greatest plasticity. These traits did not correspond with traits with the largest amount of intraspecific variation. Plasticity in leaf functional traits tended to enable plant populations to shift their trait values toward the mean values of a transplanted plants\u2019 destination community, but only if that population started with very different trait values. These results suggest that leaf trait plasticity is an important mechanism for enabling plants to persist within communities and to better tolerate changing environmental conditions under climate change. \u00a9 2018 Henn, Buzzard, Enquist, Halbritter, Klanderud, Maitner, Michaletz, P\u00f6tsch, Seltzer, Telford, Yang, Zhang and Vandvik."

The diversifying brewing industry demands variation in flavors, superior process properties, and sustainable agronomics, which are the focus of advanced molecular breeding efforts in hops. Hop breeders have been limited in their ability to create strains with desirable traits, however, because of the unusual and unpredictable inheritance patterns and associated non-Mendelian genetic marker segregation. Cytogenetic analysis of meiotic chromosome behavior has also revealed conspicuous and prevalent occurrences of multiple, atypical, non-disomic chromosome complexes, including those involving autosomes in late prophase. To explore the role of meiosis in segregation distortion, we undertook 3D cytogenetic analysis of hop pollen mother cells stained with DAPI and FISH. We used telomere FISH to demonstrate that hop exhibits a normal telomere clustering bouquet. We also identified and characterized a new sub-terminal 180 bp satellite DNA tandem repeat family called HSR0, located proximal to telomeres. Highly variable 5S rDNA FISH patterns within and between plants, together with the detection of anaphase chromosome bridges, reflect extensive departures from normal disomic signal composition and distribution. Subsequent FACS analysis revealed variable DNA content in a cultivated pedigree. Together, these findings implicate multiple phenomena, including aneuploidy, segmental aneuploidy, or chromosome rearrangements, as contributing factors to segregation distortion in hop. \u00a9 2018 Easterling, Pitra, Jones, Lopes, Aquino, Zhang, Matthews and Bass."

Ancient woodland indicators (AWIs) are plant species considered indicative of sites that have been continuously wooded for a long period by virtue of poor dispersal ability and intolerance of non-woodland habitats. Many countries now utilise AWI species lists to classify ancient woodlands. Here we use a metastudy approach to test resilience of AWIs to interruptions and persistence following deforestation \u2212 and thus the robustness of using AWI lists \u2212 using a novel approach. We compare current AWI assemblage with woodland history based on pollen evidence at nine sites across the UK with a robustly-dated and spatially-precise palynological profile. Sites were split into: (1) proven continuous woodland; (2) previously interrupted woodland; and (3) previously but not currently wooded. Vegetation history was >1000 years at most sites. Assessment of ancientness using AWIs agreed with palynologically-proven ancient woodland at two sites, including a species-poor woodland of previously-uncertain age. However, four interrupted woodland sites and three clear-felled sites supported extensive AWI floristic communities. This suggests AWIs are resilient to interruptions, possibly by remaining in the seed bank longer than expected, and persistent following deforestation. Persistence might be due to other species (e.g. heathland plants) acting as pseudo-canopy or because some AWIs are more tolerant of non-woodland locations than previously thought. We conclude that use of floristic AWIs alone in defining ancient woodland should be reviewed, especially where status links to planning policy and conservation prioritisation. We suggest species on AWI lists be reviewed under expert and local guidance and a system of weighting species based on their strict or strong affinity solely with ancient woodland be developed. The use of multi-taxa indicators is recommended to allow stakeholders globally to make informed decisions about ancient woodland status. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Aerial drone imagery and photogrammetric techniques promise to advance the study of phenology by enabling the creation of distortion-free orthomosaics of plant canopies at the landscape scale, but with branch-level image resolution. The main goal of this study is to determine the leaf life cycle events corresponding to phenological metrics derived from automated analyses based on color indices calculated from drone imagery. For an oak-dominated, temperate deciduous forest in the northeastern USA, we find that plant area index (PAI) correlates with a canopy greenness index during spring green-up, and a canopy redness index during autumn senescence. Additionally, greenness and redness metrics are significantly correlated with the timing of budburst and leaf expansion on individual trees in spring. However, we note that the specific color index for individual trees must be carefully chosen if new foliage in spring appears red, rather than green\u2014which we observed for some oak trees. In autumn, both decreasing greenness and increasing redness correlate with leaf senescence. Maximum redness indicates the beginning of leaf fall, and the progression of leaf fall correlates with decreasing redness. We also find that cooler air temperature microclimates near a forest edge bordering a wetland advance the onset of senescence. These results demonstrate the use of drones for characterizing the organismic-level variability of phenology in a forested landscape and advance our understanding of which phenophase transitions correspond to color-based metrics derived from digital image analysis. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.

In particular, environmental sensors and cameras are widely used in existing agricultural support systems for easy data collection. Although the traditional purpose of these systems is naive monitoring and controlling of the environment, the propagation of advanced cultivation is now expected by applying the data to machine learning and data mining technologies. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-modal sliding window-based support vector regression (multi-modal SW-SVR) method for accurate prediction of complicated water stress, which is a plant status, from two data types, namely environmental and plant image data. The proposed method includes two methodologies, SW-SVR and deep neural network (DNN) as a multi-modal feature extractor for SW-SVR. SW-SVR, which we proposed previously, is a suitable learning method for data with time-dependent characteristics, such as plant status. Moreover, we propose a new image feature, remarkable moving objects detected by adjacent optical flow (ROAF), to enable DNN to extract essential features easily for predicting water stress. Compared with existing regression models and features, the proposed multi-modal SW-SVR with ROAF demonstrates more precise and stable water stress prediction. \u00a9 2017 The Authors"

The average content of total soluble sugars, starch and total soluble proteins was found to be 43.66, 360.51 and 204.54\u00a0mg/g, respectively. Antioxidant potential in terms of free radical scavenging activity (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), reducing power, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and superoxide anion radical scavenging activity was estimated. The diversity was observed in genotypes with all the traits. AL 1960, AL 2000, AL 2009 and AL 2046 had high total soluble proteins, medium antinutritional factors and good antioxidant potential. AL 201, AL 1931, AL 1932, AL 1960, AL 2046, AL 2049 and AL 2060 had good nutritional value as protein and starch content ranged from 20 to 23 and 42 to 52%, respectively. Wild species C. scarabaeoides 1CP15683/W15 had lower carbohydrates, proteins, and antinutritional traits while high antioxidant potential due to high total phenols, DPPH, FRAP and reducing power. The diversity observed in genotypes with all the traits could be further used to develop nutritionally important genotypes. \u00a9 2017, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India)."

However, phenols from cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL, Anacardium occidentale) and from Aroeira (Myracrodruon urundeuva) extract have never been evaluated. The present investigation aimed to compare the dentin collagen crosslinking (biomodification) effectiveness of polyphenols from Aroeira stem bark extract, proanthocyanidins (PACs) from grape-seed extract (Vitis vinifera), cardol and cardanol from CNSL after clinically relevant treatment for one minute. Methods Three-point bending test was used to obtain the elastic modulus of fully demineralized dentin beams before and after biomodification, whilst color change and mass variation were evaluated after four weeks water biodegradation. Color aspect was assessed by optical images after biodegradation whereas collagen cross-linking was investigated by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Statistical analysis was performed with repeated-measures two way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p < 0.05). Results The increase in elastic modulus after biomodification was in the order cardol > cardanol > aroeira = PACs with cardol solution achieving mean 338.2% increase. The mass increase after biomodification followed the same order aforementioned. Nevertheless, after four weeks aging, more hydrophobic agent (cardanol) induced the highest resistance against water biodegradation. Aroeira and cardol attained intermediate outcomes whereas PACs provided the lower resistance. Tannin-based agents (Aroeira and PACs) stained the specimens in dark brown color. No color alteration was observed with cardol and cardanol treatments. All four agents achieved crosslinking in micro-Raman after one minute application. Significance In conclusion, major components of CNSL yield overall best dentin biomodification outcomes when applied for one minute without staining the dentin collagen. \u00a9 2017 The Academy of Dental Materials"

Few large trials have determined switchgrass yields at field scale on marginal lands, including analysis of production costs. Thus, a field-scale study was conducted to develop realistic yield and cost estimates for diverse regions of the USA. Objectives included measuring switchgrass response to fertility treatments (0, 56, and 112\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha\u22121) and generating corresponding estimates of production costs for sites with diverse soil and climatic conditions. Trials occurred in Iowa, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Virginia, USA. Cultivars and management practices were site specific, and field-scale equipment was used for all management practices. Input costs were estimated using final harvest-year (2015) prices, and equipment operation costs were estimated with the MachData model ($2015). Switchgrass yields generally were below those reported elsewhere, averaging 6.3\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 across sites and treatments. Establishment stand percent ranged from 28% to 76% and was linked to initial year production. No response to N was observed at any site in the first production year. In subsequent seasons, N generally increased yields on well-drained soils; however, responses to N were nil or negative on less well-drained soils. Greatest percent increases in response to 112\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha\u22121 were 57% and 76% on well-drained South Dakota and Virginia sites, where breakeven prices to justify N applications were over $70 and $63\u00a0Mg\u22121, respectively. For some sites, typically promoted N application rates may be economically unjustified; it remains unknown whether a bioenergy industry can support the breakeven prices estimated for sites where N inputs had positive effects on switchgrass yield. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

            "text": "Rationale: The position of C=C within fatty acyl chains affects the biological function of lipids. Ozone-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (OzID-MS) has great potential in determination of lipid double-bond position, but has generally been implemented on low-resolution ion trap mass spectrometers. In addition, most of the OzID-MS experiments carried out so far were focused on the sodiated adducts of lipids; fragmentation of the most commonly observed protonated ions generated in LC/MS-based lipidomics workflow has been less explored. Methods: Ozone generated in line from an ozone generator was connected to the trap and transfer gas supply line of a Synapt G2 high-resolution mass spectrometer. Protonated ions of different phosphatidylcholines (PC) were generated by electrospray ionization through direct infusion. Different parameters, including traveling wave height and velocity, trap entrance and DC potential, were adjusted to maximize the OzID efficiency. sn-positional isomers and cis/trans isomers of lipids were compared for their reactivity with ozone. Results: Traveling wave height and velocity were tuned to prolong the encounter time between lipid ions and ozone, and resulted in improved OzID efficiency, as did increasing trapping region DC and entrance potential. Under optimized settings, at least 1000 times enhancement in OzID efficiency was achieved compared to that under default settings for monounsaturated PC standards. Monounsaturated C=C in the sn-2 PC isomer reacted faster with ozone than the sn-1 isomer. Similarly, the C=C in trans PC reacted faster than in cis PC. Conclusions: This is the first implementation of OzID in the trap and transfer region of a traveling wave enabled high-resolution mass spectrometer. The OzID reaction efficiency is significantly improved by slowing down ions in the trap region for their prolonged interaction with ozone. This will facilitate application of high-resolution OzID-MS in lipidomics. Copyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Results showed that the germination rate remained constant when seed moisture content (MC) decreased from 48% (fresh seeds) to 45.1%. However, when MC reached 40.1%, the germination percentage decreased from 92% to 50%. A significant positive correlation was observed between the MC and seed germination percentage (r = 0.910). The electrical conductivity was significantly increased during the initial desiccation (48-45.1%). Furthermore, both the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activity first reduced, then elevated to peak values before they declined again. POD activity rose earlier than SOD activity, indicating that the POD reaction was more desiccation-sensitive than the SOD. Significant negative correlations were observed between the MC and malondialdehyde (MDA) content (r = -0.619) and electrical conductivity (r = -0.745). Our collective results suggest that G. biloba seeds are highly sensitive to desiccation. Excessive desiccation could reduce the antioxidant enzyme activity of G. biloba seeds and intensify membrane lipid peroxidation, which causes the consequent reduction-or even the complete loss-of seed germinability. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.

            "text": "During evolution, plants evolved various reactions to wounding. Fast wound sealing and subsequent healing represent a selective advantage of particular importance for plants growing in arid habitats. An effective self-sealing function by internal deformation has been found in the succulent leaves of Delosperma cooperi. After a transversal incision, the entire leaf bends until the wound is closed. Our results indicate that the underlying sealing principle is a combination of hydraulic shrinking and swelling as the main driving forces and growth-induced mechanical pre-stresses in the tissues. Hydraulic effects were measured in terms of the relative bending angle over 55 minutes under various humidity conditions. The higher the relative air humidity, the lower the bending angle. Negative bending angles were found when a droplet of liquid water was applied to the wound. The statistical analysis revealed highly significant differences of the single main effects such as \"humidity conditions in the wound region\" and \"time after wounding\" and their interaction effect. The centripetal arrangement of five tissue layers with various thicknesses and significantly different mechanical properties might play an additional role with regard to mechanically driven effects. Injury disturbs the mechanical equilibrium, with pre-stresses leading to internal deformation until a new equilibrium is reached. In the context of selfsealing by internal deformation, the highly flexible wide-band tracheids, which form a net of vascular bundles, are regarded as paedomorphic tracheids, which are specialised to prevent cell collapse under drought stress and allow for building growth-induced mechanical pre-stresses. \u00a9 2018 Speck et al."

The main components determined by GC-MS for Myrtus communis essential oil were Eucalyptol (45,41%), \u03b1-Pinene (20,86%), Linalool (9,71%), \u03b1-Terpineol (6,11%) and Limonene (5,88%) and for Micromeria fruticosa L. essential oil were Pulegone (58,32%), p-Menthan-3-one (12,99%) and Levomenthol (9,85%). Antibacterial activities of Myrtus communis and Micromeria fruticosa essential oils were searched against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter aerogenes. In order to evaluate the MIC values of the bacterial strains, Minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) determined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory standards. Amikacin was selected as standard drug for bacterial strains. As a result, it has been found that Myrtus communis and Micromeria fruticosa essential oils are very promising against these bacteria, which are among the major infectious agents in the world as well as in our country. Essential oils of these plants have been found very promising in the production of new antimicrobials. Further in vivo studies are needed in this regard. \u00a9 2018, Inst. Nat.

This paper aims to deal with the phytoremediation approach for protection of environment and preventing the streaming of contaminant flows to hydrological systems. Phytoremediation is a cost-effective environmentally friendly clean-up technology, which uses plants and microorganisms in rhizosphere for soil and groundwater treatment. Phytoremediation is enhancing degradation of organic pollutants and improving stabilization of inorganic contaminants where plants can be used to treat soil and water polluted with hydrocarbons, chlorinated substances, pesticides, metals, explosives, radionuclides as well as to reduce the excess of nutrients. Selection of species for this type of treatment processes is based on evapotranspiration potential and ability to bioaccumulate contaminants. The project entitled \u201cPhytoremediation Park for treatment and recreation at glassworks contaminated sites\u201c (PHYTECO) aimed at cross-sector international partnership. The challenge of project was to develop remediation strategy where negative consequences from centuries long anthropogenic influence are turned to be something positive - development of the recreation park from the glass dump. Here designers, scientists, local volunteers, international students would join ideas and common work for the boost of innovation and sustainable thinking.

            "text": "Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a root crop used as a foodstuff and as a starch source in industry. Starch functional properties are influenced by many structural features including the relative amounts of the two glucan polymers amylopectin and amylose, the branched structure of amylopectin, starch granule size and the presence of covalent modifications. Starch phosphorylation, where phosphates are linked either to the C3 or C6 carbon atoms of amylopectin glucosyl residues, is a naturally occurring modification known to be important for starch remobilization. The degree of phosphorylation has been altered in several crops using biotechnological approaches to change expression of the starch-phosphorylating enzyme GLUCAN WATER DIKINASE (GWD). Interestingly, this frequently alters other structural features of starch beside its phosphate content. Here, we aimed to alter starch phosphorylation in cassava storage roots either by manipulating the expression of the starch phosphorylating or dephosphorylating enzymes. Therefore, we generated transgenic plants in which either the wild-type potato GWD (StGWD) or a redox-insensitive version of it were overexpressed. Further plants were created in which we used RNAi to silence each of the endogenous phosphoglucan phosphatase genes STARCH EXCESS 4 (MeSEX4) and LIKE SEX4 2 (MeLSF), previously discovered by analyzing leaf starch metabolism in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpressing the potato GWD gene (StGWD), which specifically phosphorylates the C6 position, increased the total starch-bound phosphate content at both the C6 and the C3 positions. Silencing endogenous LSF2 gene (MeLSF2), which specifically dephosphorylates the C3 position, increased the ratio of C3:C6 phosphorylation, showing that its function is conserved in storage tissues. In both cases, other structural features of starch (amylopectin structure, amylose content and starch granule size) were unaltered. This allowed us to directly relate the physicochemical properties of the starch to its phosphate content or phosphorylation pattern. Starch swelling power and paste clarity were specifically influenced by total phosphate content. However, phosphate position did not significantly influence starch functional properties. In conclusion, biotechnological manipulation of starch phosphorylation can specifically alter certain cassava storage root starch properties, potentially increasing its value in food and non-food industries. \u00a9 2018 Wang, Hostettler, Damberger, Kossmann, Lloyd and Zeeman."

However, it is unclear whether these beneficial roles of DHA and EPA are associated with alterations of fatty acid (FA) composition in the liver. This study evaluated the positive impacts of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) containing different DHA/EPA ratios on HFD-induced liver disease and alterations of the hepatic FA composition. ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice were fed with HFDs with various ratios of DHA/EPA (2: 1, 1: 1, and 1: 2) and an n-6/n-3 ratio of 4: 1 for 12 weeks. After treatment, the serum and hepatic FA compositions, serum biochemical parameters, liver injury, and hepatic lipid metabolism-related gene expression were determined. Our results demonstrated that dietary DHA/EPA changed serum and hepatic FA composition by increasing contents of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs and decreasing amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and the n-6/n-3 ratio. Among the three DHA/EPA groups, the DHA/EPA 2: 1 group tended to raise n-3 PUFAs concentration and lower the n-6/n-3 ratio in the liver, whereas DHA/EPA 1: 2 tended to raise n-6 PUFAs concentration and improve the n-6/n-3 ratio. DHA/EPA supplementation reduced the hepatic impairment of lipid homeostasis, oxidative stress, and the inflammatory responses in HFD-fed mice. The DHA/EPA 2: 1 group had lower serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher levels of adiponectin than HFD group. The DHA/EPA 1: 2 group had elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase, without significant change the expression of genes for inflammation or hepatic lipid metabolism among the three DHA/EPA groups. The results suggest that DHA/EPA-enriched diet with an n-6/n-3 ratio of 4: 1 may reverse HFD-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to some extent by increasing n-6 and n-3 PUFAs and decreasing the amount of MUFAs and the n-6/n-3 ratio.

The present study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant activity and toxicity of isopropyl caffeate through in silico, in vitro and in vivo testing. The results showed that isopropyl caffeate presents no significant theoretical risk of toxicity, with likely moderate bioactivity: GPCR binding, ion channel modulation, nuclear receptor binding, and enzyme inhibition. Isopropyl caffeate induced hemolysis only at the concentrations of 500 and 1000 \u03bcg/ml. We observed types A and O erythrocyte protection from osmotic stress, no oxidation of erythrocytes, and even sequestrator and antioxidant behavior. However, moderate toxicity, according to the classification of GHS, was demonstrated through depressant effects on the central nervous system, though there was no influence on water and food consumption or on weight gain, and it did present possible hepatoprotection. We conclude that the effects induced by isopropyl caffeate are due to its antioxidant activity, capable of preventing production of free radicals and oxidative stress, a promising molecule with pharmacological potential.

Field dodder is known to spend its entire vegetation period as a parasite plant on its hosts after germinating from the soil. It causes significant yield and quality loss of many cultivated plants, including sugar beet. In this study, the influence of dodder on leaf chlorophyll a and b, total chlorophyll levels, leaf yield, wet and dry leaf weight, and leaf ash weight of sugar beet was investigated. For this purpose, two varieties of sugar beet (Valentina and 551) were cultivated in two growing areas as groups of infected and uninfected sugar beet. Sugar beet leaf numbers and associated hectare yield decreased considerably when the plants were infected with the parasite. Crop yield per hectare was calculated to be 79,573.9 kg/ha for uninfected plots while it was determined as 57,341.3 kg/ha for the infected ones. Average leaf yield (32,943.6 kg/ha for uninfected versus 18,451.4 kg/ha for infected), tuber sizes (28.116 \u00d7 8.244 cm for uninfected versus 18.984 \u00d7 6.269 cm for infected), the amounts of chlorophyll a (4.020 and 1.650 mg/g) and chlorophyll b (1.67 and 1.29 mg/g), and total chlorophyll values (5.69 and 2.94 mg/g) were all observed to decline when the crops were infected by field dodder. \u00a9 T\u00dcB\u0130TAK."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of PD on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using a high fat induced obese mice model. The studied subjects were randomly divided into a lean group, a high fat diet (HFD) group, and a high fat diet with PD (HFD + PD) group. The results showed that PD reduced the body weights in HFD mice. PD also downregulated the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and upregulated high density lipoprotein (HDL). Moreover, PD significantly alleviated hepatocyte steatosis and reduced Gr-1+ cells in the liver tissues of HFD mice. The mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory factors, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly decreased in the liver tissues of HFD mice with PD treatment, and the downregulation of MCP-1 and S100A9 protein expressions was also observed. In conclusion, PD had beneficial roles in suppressing lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and anti-inflammatory responses in the liver tissue of obese associated NAFLD. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

Trinexapac-ethyl, which is a plant growth regulator, can positively affect eucalyptus, a response known as hormesis, possibly providing plants with greater tolerance to stress. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of trinexapac-ethyl at two application times, before planting (BP) or after planting (AP), in Eucalyptus urophylla under conditions of nutritional deficiency (NPK). Two experiments (one for each application time) were conducted simultaneously during 81 days after planting of eucalyptus in 15 L pots. The treatments consisted of three doses of trinexapac-ethyl (0, 30, and 60 g a.i.\u00b7ha\u22121) and four variations of nutrient supply: complete solution (NPK) and solutions without nitrogen (\u2212N), without phosphorus (\u2212P), and without potassium (\u2212K). The variables of gas exchange, growth, and dry matter were evaluated. For both application times, trinexapac-ethyl had a positive effect on the root\u2013shoot ratio of plants grown in \u2212N and also positively affected some eucalyptus photosynthetic characteristics. In the AP application, the compound provided gains in height and dry matter, regardless of the nutrient supply. Under phosphorus deficiency, trinexapac-ethyl provided gains in total dry matter (BP) and leaf area (AP). \u00a9 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved."

Incorporating alternative forages into grazing systems could be an approach for reducing N2O emissions through mechanisms such as release of biological nitrification inhibitors from roots and increased root depth. Field plot and lysimeter (intact soil column) trials were conducted in a free draining Horotiu silt loam soil to test whether two alternative forage species, plantain (Plantago lanceolate L.) and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), could reduce N2O emissions relative to traditional pasture species, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The amounts of N2O emitted from the soil below each forage species, which all received the same cow urine at the same rates, was measured using an established static chamber method. Total N2O emissions from the plantain, lucerne and perennial ryegrass controls (without urine application) were generally very low, but emissions from the white clover control were significantly higher. When urine was applied in autumn or winter N2O emissions from plantain were lower compared with those from perennial ryegrass or white clover, but this difference was not found when urine was applied in summer. Lucerne had lower emissions in winter but not in other seasons. Incorporation of plantain into grazed pasture could be an approach to reduce N2O emissions. However, further work is required to understand the mechanisms for the reduced emissions and the effects of environmental conditions in different seasons. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V."

In this study, we examined the effect of B. alba leaves on the growth of Spodoptera litura larvae. B. alba leaves and a methanolic extract of the leaves inhibited the growth of S. litura larvae. Half of the larvae reared on the leaves died within 1 week. We found that two flavonoids, vitexin, and vitexin- 2\u2033-O-Arabinofuranoside, were abundant in the methanol extract of leaves. When larvae were reared on purified vitexin or vitexin-2\u2033-O-Arabinofuranoside, their growth was significantly impaired compared with larvae reared on control spinach leaves. These results suggested that the flavonoid glycosides in B. alba leaves act as deterrents to S. litura larvae. \u00a9 2017 Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry."

Once covalently bound, SUMO conjugation can change the stability or functionality of its cognate target proteins. SUMO protease can rapidly reverse SUMO conjugation making this modification system highly dynamic. A major factor in the variation of SUMO-target function is the balance between the conjugated/de-conjugated forms. The mechanistic role of these regulatory SUMO proteases in mediating stress responses has not been defined in any crops. In this study, we reveal the role of the SUMO protease, OsOTS1 in mediating tolerance to drought in rice. OsOTS1 depleted transgenic plants accumulate more ABA and exhibit more productive agronomic traits during drought while OsOTS1 overexpressing lines are drought sensitive but ABA insensitive. Drought and ABA treatment stimulates the degradation of OsOTS1 protein indicating that SUMO conjugation is an important response to drought stress in rice achieved through down-regulation of OTS1/2 activity. We reveal that OsOTS1 SUMO protease directly targets the ABA and drought responsive transcription factor OsbZIP23 for de-SUMOylation affecting its stability. OsOTS-RNAi lines show increased abundance of OsbZIP23 and increased drought responsive gene expression while OsOTS1 overexpressing lines show reduced levels of OsbZIP23 leading to suppressed drought responsive gene expression. Our data reveal a mechanism in which rice plants govern ABA-dependant drought responsive gene expression by controlling the stability of OsbZIP23 by SUMO conjugation through manipulating specific SUMO protease levels. \u00a9 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Using high-resolution thermogravimetric analysis, the composition of biomass samples from two shrub willow (Salix spp.) yield trial networks representing two distinct datasets were examined. Dataset 1 consisted of 12 yield trials containing 10 genotypes that mainly represented early cultivars from the US breeding program. Dataset 2 consisted of five trial locations containing 19 genotypes from later breeding efforts. Variation in ash and hemicellulose content were largely controlled by genetic factors, while cellulose and lignin content were heavily influenced by environmental effects. Mean biomass composition traits for dataset 1 were 2.1% ash, 42.4% cellulose, 18.7% hemicellulose and 25.5% lignin. For dataset 2 mean traits were 1.9% ash, 43.2% cellulose, 17.7% hemicellulose and 25.7% lignin. Yield was negatively correlated with lignin content and positively correlated with cellulose content at the level of environment. Elite triploid hybrid cultivars have the potential to produce more cellulose per unit area because of higher yields and/or greater cellulose content. These findings suggest that selection of genotypes for improved yield, as well as selection of growing environment, can improve feedstock quality for biofuel production. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V."

We aim to detect the degree of animation of plants based on the magnification of the small color changes in the plant's green leaves using the Eulerian video magnification. Capturing the video under a controlled environment, e.g., using a tripod and direct current light sources, reduces camera movements and minimizes light fluctuations; we aim to reduce the external factors as much as possible. The acquired video is then stabilized and a proposed algorithm is used to reduce the illumination variations. Finally, the Euler magnification is utilized to magnify the color changes on the light invariant video. The proposed system does not require any special purpose instruments as it uses a digital camera with a regular frame rate. The results of magnified color changes on both natural and plastic leaves show that the live green leaves have color changes in contrast to the plastic leaves. Hence, we can argue that the color changes of the leaves are due to biological operations, such as photosynthesis. To date, this is possibly the first work that focuses on interpreting visually, some biological operations of plants without any special purpose instruments. \u00a9 2017 SPIE and IS&T."

MDA is a precursor to methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), a hard block component in polyurethane (PUR) synthesis. This work focuses on comparing MALDI results to those of our previous electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies. In ESI, 2-ring MDA isomers formed single unique [M + H]+ (199 Da) parent ions, whereas in MALDI each isomer shows significant formation of three precursor ions: [M - H]+ = 197 Da, [M\u2022]+ = 198 Da, and [M + H]+ = 199 Da. Structures and schemes are proposed for the MALDI fragment ions associated with each precursor ion. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and computational methods were all critical in determining the structures for both precursor and fragment ions as well as the fragmentation mechanisms. The present study indicates that the [M - H]+ and [M\u2022]+ ions are formed by the MALDI process, explaining why they were not observed with ESI. \u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society."

Molecular and microbotanical data provide a partial picture of the timing and nature of morphological change, with genetic data indicating that alleles for some domestication traits were not yet fixed by 5,300 cal B.P. in the highlands of Mexico. Here, we report 88 radiocarbon dates on the botanical remains from El Gigante rockshelter (Honduras) to establish a Bayesian chronology over the past \u223c11,000 y spanning the transition to maize-based food production. Botanical remains are remarkably well preserved and include over 10,000 maize macrofossils. We directly dated 37 maize cobs to establish the appearance and local change of maize at the site. Cobs are common in deposits dating between 4,340 and 4,020 cal B.P., and again between 2,350 and 980 cal B.P. The earliest cobs appear robustly domesticated, having 10\u201314 rows, suggesting strong selection for increased yield. The later cobs are comparable to these earliest ones, but show clear emergence of diverse traits, including increased cob width, rachis segment length, and cupule width. Our results indicate that domesticated landraces of maize productive enough to be a staple grain existed in Central America by 4,300 cal B.P. \u00a9 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

            "text": "Curcumin is a plant secondary metabolite with outstanding therapeutic effects. Therefore, there is a great interest in developing new strategies to produce this high-value compound in a cheaper and environmentally friendly way. Curcumin heterologous production in Escherichia coli using artificial biosynthetic pathways was previously demonstrated using synthetic biology approaches. However, the culturing conditions to produce this compound were not optimized and so far only a two-step fermentation process involving the exchange of culture medium allowed high concentrations of curcumin to be obtained, which limits its production at an industrial scale. In this study, the culturing conditions to produce curcumin were evaluated and optimized. In addition, itwas concluded that E. Coli BL21 allows higher concentrations of curcumin to be produced than E. Coli K-12 strains. Different isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside concentrations, timeof protein expression induction andsubstrate type and concentrationwere also evaluated. The highest curcumin production obtainedwas 959.3 mM(95.93% of per cent yield), whichwas 3.1-fold higher than the highest concentration previously reported. This concentration was obtained using a two-stage fermentation with lysogeny broth (LB) and M9. Moreover, terrific brothwas also demonstrated to be a very interesting alternative mediumto produce curcumin because it also led to high concentrations (817.7 mM). The use of this single fermentation medium represents an advantage at industrial scale and, although the final production is lower than that obtained with the LB- M9 combination, it leads to a significantly higher production of curcumin in the first 24 h of fermentation. This study allowed obtaining the highest concentrations of curcumin reported so far in a heterologous organismand is of interest for all of those working with the heterologous production of curcuminoids, other complex polyphenolic compounds or plant secondary metabolites. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of light and soil moisture competition on underseeded red clover establishment and end of season dry matter production. Field trials were conducted at multiple locations in 2005 and 2006 in Ontario, Canada. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N rate (67 and 135 kg N ha-1) and row thinning treatments (19-cm rows, every third 19-cm row removed at the 4-5 leaf stage) were used to alter light penetration and soil moisture competition. The high N rate and row thinning treatments consistently reduced light penetration, beginning as early as wheat stem elongation initiation, but had no effect on soil gravimetric moisture content. Soil moisture was primarily affected by location and year. Red clover dry weight in 2005, a relatively dry year, ranged from 688 to 1184 kg ha-1, and in 2006, a relatively wet year, ranged from 2336 to 2805 kg ha-1. Average final red clover stand count was 23 plants m-2 in 2005 and 55 plants m-2 in 2006. In 2005, plant mortality occurred before wheat anthesis. In both years, and at most locations, red clover final dry weight was positively correlated with light penetration, again beginning as early as initiation of wheat stem elongation. Final red clover dry weight in both years and red clover stand count in 2005 were correlated with soil gravimetric water content during wheat anthesis, but this was primarily due to location and year effects. Although both light penetration through the wheat canopy and soil moisture influence biomass production of underseeded red clover, soil moisture has the greater influence and is altered very little by wheat management. \u00a9 2009 by the American Society of Agronomy."

The aim of the present study was to analyse nuclear genome size in a phylogenetic framework and to assess relationships between genome size and ploidy, breeding system and selected ecogeographic features. \u2022 Methods: Holoploid and monoploid genome sizes (C- and Cx-values) of 215 cultivated plants from 89 field populations of 42 so-called 'basic' Hieracium species were determined using propidium iodide flow cytometry. Chromosome counts were available for all analysed plants, and all plants were tested experimentally for their mode of reproduction (sexuality vs. apomixis). For constructing molecular phylogenetic trees, the external transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA was used. \u2022 Key Results: The mean 2C values differed up to 2.37-fold among different species (from 7.03 pg in diploid to 16.67 in tetraploid accessions). The 1Cx values varied 1.22-fold (between 3.51 and 4.34 pg). Variation in 1Cx values between conspecific (species in a broad sense) accessions ranged from 0.24% to 7.2%. Little variation (not exceeding the approximate measurement inaccurracy threshold of 3.5%) was found in 33 species, whereas variation higher than 3.5% was detected in seven species. Most of the latter may have a polytopic origin. Mean 1Cx values of the three cytotypes (2n, 3n and 4 n) differed significantly (average of 3.93 pg in diploids, 3.82 pg in triploids and 3.78 pg in tetraploids) indicating downsizing of genomes in polyploids. The pattern of genome size variation correlated well with two major phylogenetic clades which were composed of species with western or eastern European origin. The monoploid genome size in the 'western' species was significantly lower than in the 'eastern' ones. Correlation of genome size with latitude, altitude and selected ecological characters (light and temperature) was not significant. A longitudinal component was only apparent for the whole data set, but absent within the major lineages. \u2022 Conclusions: Phylogeny was the most important factor explaining the pattern of genome size variation in Hieracium sensu stricto, species of western European origin having significantly lower genome size in comparison with those of eastern European origin. Any correlation with ecogeographic variables, including longitude, was outweighed by the divergence of the genus into two major phylogenetic lineages. \u00a9 The Author 2009.

Here we report the diverse expression patterns of the OsSPX genes in different tissues and their responses to Pi-starvation. Among them, five genes, OsSPX1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are responsive to Pi-starvation in shoots and/or in roots. The subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 is exclusively located in nucleus, OsSPX3 in the cytoplasm, and OsSPX4 is a membrane localization protein. OsSPX1 regulates OsSPX2, 3 and 5 at the transcription level and is positively involved in the responses of the genes to Pi-starvation. Overexpression of OsSPX3 downregulates OsSPX5 in shoots under Pi-sufficiency. OsSPX3 negatively regulates the PSI (Pi-starvation induced) gene, OsIPS1 and is involved in the responses of miR399 and OsPHO2 to Pi-starvation. Our results suggest that OsSPX1 may be a regulator involved in the transcriptions of OsSPX2, 3 and 5. OsSPX3 plays a role in OsIPS1/miR399 mediated long distance regulation on OsPHO2. Our results also indicate that OsSPX3 is involved in plant tolerance to Pi-starvation stress. \u00a9 2009 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences."

            "text": "Electron transfer pathways associated to oxygenic photosynthesis, including cyclic electron flow around photosystem I and chlororespiration, rely on non-photochemical reduction of plastoquinones (PQs). In higher plant chloroplasts, a bacterial-like NDH complex homologous to complex I is involved in PQ reduction, but such a complex is absent from Chlamydomonas plastids where a type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity has been proposed to operate. With the aim to elucidate the nature of the enzyme-supporting non-photochemical reduction of PQs, one of the type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases identified in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome (Nda2) was produced as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and further characterized. As many type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases, Nda2 uses NADH as a preferential substrate, but in contrast to the eukaryotic enzymes described so far, contains non-covalently bound FMN as a cofactor. When expressed at a low level, Nda2 complements growth of an E. coli lacking both NDH-1 and NDH-2, but is toxic at high expression levels. Using an antibody raised against the recombinant protein and based on its mass spectrometric identification, we show that Nda2 is localized in thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements performed on thylakoid membranes show that Nda2 is able to interact with thylakoid membranes of C. reinhardtii by reducing PQs from exogenous NADH or NADPH. We discuss the possible involvement of Nda2 in cyclic electron flow around PSI, chlororespiration, and hydrogen production. \u00a9 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

Shqlp has been identified as an essential eukaryotic H/ACA small nucleolar (sno) ribonucleoparticle (snoRNP) biogenesis and assembly factor. Shq1p is postulated to be involved in the early biogenesis steps of H/ACA snoRNP complexes, and Shq1p depletion leads to a specific decrease in H/ACA small nucleolar RNA levels and to defects in ribosomal RNA processing. Shq1p contains two predicted domains as follows: an N-terminal CS (named after CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1) or HSP20-like domain, and a C-terminal region of high sequence homology called the Shq1 domain. Here we report the crystal structure and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Shq1p CS domain. The structure consists of a compact antiparallel \u03b2-sandwich fold that is composed of two \u03b2-sheets containing four and three \u03b2-strands, respectively, and a short \u03b1-helix. Deletion studies showed that the CS domain is required for the essential functions of Shq1p. Point mutations in residues Phe-6, Gln-10, and Lys-80 destabilize Shq1p in vivo and induce a temperature-sensitive phenotype with depletion of H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs and defects in rRNA processing. Although CS domains are frequently found in co-chaperones of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone, no interaction was detected between the Shq1p CS domain and yeast Hsp90 in vitro. These results show that the CS domain is essential for Shq1p function in H/ACA snoRNP biogenesis in vivo, possibly in an Hsp90-independent manner. \u00a9 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

In addition, epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate were found as the major active components responsible for the antioxidant activity of tea flowers through the use of a combination of preparative liquid chromatography separation and DPPH assay. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Plants were grown hydroponically on standard Murashige and Skoog (MS) culture solutions. Arsenic concentrations in Fe-oxide (Fe-plaque) on plant surfaces were determined by citrate-bicarbonate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CBE) technique. S. polyrhiza L. accumulated 51-fold arsenic from arsenate solution compared to that from DMAA solution with initial concentrations of 4.0 and 0.02 \u03bcM of arsenic and phosphate, respectively. The arsenate uptake was negatively (p < 0.001) correlated with phosphate uptake and positively (p < 0.05) correlated with iron uptake. About 56% of the total arsenic was accumulated into the plant tissues while 44% was adsorbed on Fe-plaque (CBE-extract), when the plants were grown on arsenate solution. The DMAA uptake into the plant was neither affected by the phosphate concentrations nor correlated (p > 0.05) with iron accumulation. The results suggest that adsorption of arsenate on Fe-plaque of the surface of S. polyrhiza L. contributes to the arsenic uptake significantly. Thus, arsenate uptake in S. polyrhiza L. occurred through the phosphate uptake pathway and by physico-chemical adsorption on Fe-plaques of plant surfaces as well. The S. polyrhiza L. uses different mechanisms for DMAA uptake. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

To reach this aim, we integrated the results of three projects on: 1. the origin, transfer and effects of heavy metals in a soil-plant-snail food chain; 2. the impact of bioavailability on effects of heavy metals on the structure and functioning of detritivorous communities; 3. the risk assessment of heavy metals for an herbivorous and a carnivorous small mammal food chain. Metal pollution levels of the Biesbosch floodplain soils are high. The bioavailability of metals in the soils is low, causing low metal levels in plant leaves. Despite this, metal concentrations in soil dwelling detritivores and in land snails at polluted locations are elevated in comparison to animals from 'non-polluted' reference sites. However, no adverse effects on ecosystem structure (species richness, density, biomass) and functioning (litter decomposition, leaf consumption, reproduction) have been found. Sediment metal pollution may pose a risk to the carnivorous small mammal food chain, in which earthworms with elevated metal concentrations are eaten by the common shrew. Additional measurements near an active metal smelter, however, show reduced leaf consumption rates and reduced reproduction by terrestrial snails, reflecting elevated metal bioavailability at this site. Since future management may also comprise reintroduction of tidal action in the Biesbosch area, changes in metal bioavailability, and as a consequence future ecosystem effects, cannot be excluded. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report the identification and characterization of a membrane-associated intracellular calcium-dependent, adipose-specific PLA2 that we named AdPLA (adipose-specific phospholipase A2). We found that AdPLA was highly expressed specifically in white adipose tissue and was induced during preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes. Clearance of AdPLA by immunoprecipitation significantly decreased PLA activity in white adipose tissue lysates but had no effect on liver lysates, where expression was hardly detectable. In characterizing AdPLA, we employed radiochemical assays with TLC analysis of the enzyme activity of lysates from COS-7 cells overexpressing AdPLA. For kinetic studies, we produced purified recombinant AdPLA for use in a lipoxidase-coupled spectrophotometric assay. AdPLA generated free fatty acid and lysophospholipid from phosphatidylcholine with a preference for hydrolysis at the sn-2 position. Although we found low but detectable lysophospholipase activity, AdPLA showed no significant activity against a variety of other lipid substrates. Calcium was found to activate AdPLA but was not essential for activity. Studies with known phospholipase inhibitors, including bromoenolactone, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate, AACOCF3, 7,7-dimethyl-5,8-eicosadienoic acid, and thioetheramide, supported that AdPLA is a phospholipase. Mutational studies showed that His-23 and Cys-113 are critical for activity of AdPLA and suggested that AdPLA is likely a His/Cys PLA 2. Overall, although AdPLA is similar to other histidine phospholipases in pH and calcium dependence, AdPLA showed different characteristics in many regards, including predicted catalytic mechanism. AdPLA may therefore represent the first member of a new group of PLA2s, group XVI. \u00a9 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

            "text": "We have investigated the photosynthetic properties of Acaryochloris marina, a cyanobacterium distinguished by having a high level of chlorophyll d, which has its absorption bands shifted to the red when compared with chlorophyll a. Despite this unusual pigment content, the overall rate and thermodynamics of the photosynthetic electron flow are similar to those of chlorophyll a-containing species. The midpoint potential of both cytochrome f and the primary electron donor of photosystem I (P740) were found to be unchanged with respect to those prevailing in organisms having chlorophyll a, being 345 and 425 mV, respectively. Thus, contrary to previous reports (Hu, Q., Miyashita, H., Iwasaki, I. I., Kurano, N., Miyachi, S., Iwaki, M., and Itoh, S. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 13319-13323), the midpoint potential of the electron donor P740 has not been tuned to compensate for the decrease in excitonic energy in A. marina and to maintain the reducing power of photosystem I. We argue that this is a weaker constraint on the engineering of the oxygenic photosynthetic electron transfer chain than preserving the driving force for plastoquinol oxidation by P740, via the cytochrome b 6f complex. We further show that there is no restriction in the diffusion of the soluble electron carrier between cytochrome b6f and photosystem I in A. marina, at variance with plants. This difference probably reflects the simplified ultrastructure of the thylakoids of this organism, where no segregation into grana and stroma lamellae is observed. Nevertheless, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements suggest that there is energy transfer between adjacent photosystem II complexes but not from photosystem II to photosystem I, indicating spatial separation between the two photosystems. \u00a9 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

Here we gained new insights to the TopIB mechanism through \"chemical mutagenesis.\" Meta-substituted analogs of Tyr274 were introduced by in vitro translation in the presence of a chemically misacylated tRNA. We report that a meta-OH reduced the rate of DNA cleavage 130-fold without affecting the rate of religation. By contrast, meta-OCH3 and NO 2 groups elicited only a 6-fold decrement in cleavage rate. We propose that the meta-OH uniquely suppresses deprotonation of the para-OH nucleophile during the cleavage step. Assembly of the vaccinia TopIB active site is triggered by protein contacts with a specific DNA sequence 5\u2032-C +5C+4C+3T+2T+1p \u2193 N (where \u2193 denotes the cleavage site). A signature \u03b1-helix of the poxvirus TopIB (132GKMKYLKENETVG144) engages the target site in the major groove and thereby recruits catalytic residue Arg 130 to the active site. The effects of 11 missense mutations at Tyr136 highlight the importance of van der Waals interactions with the 3\u2032-G+4pG+3p dinucleotide of the nonscissile strand for DNA cleavage and supercoil relaxation. Asn140 and Thr 142 donate hydrogen bonds to the pro-(Sp)-oxygen of the G+3pA+2 phosphodiester of the nonscissile strand. Lys 133 and Lys135 interact with purine nucleobases in the major groove. Whereas none of these side chains is essential per se, an N140A/T142A double mutation reduces the rate of supercoil relaxation and DNA cleavage by 120- and 30-fold, respectively, and a K133A/K135A double mutation slows relaxation and cleavage by 120- and 35-fold, respectively. These results underscore functional redundancy at the TopIB-DNA interface. \u00a9 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

Also, LA was estimated using the model proposed by Rouphael et al. (2007). Measured LA was exponentially related with L and W, and the W-LA relationships showed higher r2. Estimated LA was strongly and exponentially related with L. Strong, linear relationships with high r2 between estimated and measured LA confirmed the high predictability of the proposed model. \u00a9 2008 Institute of Experimental Botany, ASCR."

In contrast to traditional photonic quasicrystals based on the Penrose tiling, these structures were obtained by removing the lattice points from a square arrangement, following the inflation rules emerging from the ThMo sequence. The resulting structure does not exhibit the typical translational symmetry of photonic crystals. In particular, it is well known that the ThMo sequence has a singular continuous Fourier transform. This property was transferred directly on the 2D ThMo photonic aperiodic crystal represented by an array of pillars in air. The electromagnetic field distribution can be described as a quasi-localized state, with characteristics lying between the localized states, corresponding to the defect state in a photonic crystal, and the Bloch states, as in the case of the eigenmode in a photonic crystal. The photonic bandgap formation was explored as a function of pillar radius. Furthermore, a preliminary investigation of the defect behaviour in square ThMo tiling was carried out. The electric field in the defect state was revealed to be strictly localized in the defect pillar. These structures provide interesting properties, which could be used to design novel optical devices."

Previously, numerous pharmacological studies using rapamycin suggested that mTOR has an important role in regulating cardiac hypertrophic growth. To further investigate this assumption, we have generated two lines of cardiac specific mTOR transgenic mice, kinase-dead (kd) mTOR and constitutively active (ca) mTOR, using \u03b1-myosin heavy chain promoter. \u03b1-Myosin heavy chain (\u03b1MHC)-mTORkd mice had a near complete inhibition of p70 S6k and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, whereas \u03b1MHC-mTORca had a significant increase in p70 S6k and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Although the cardiac function of \u03b1MHC-mTORkd mice was significantly altered, the cardiac morphology of these transgenic mice was normal. The cardiac hypertrophic growth in response to physiological and pathological stimuli was not different in \u03b1MHC-mTORkd and \u03b1MHC-mTORca transgenic mice when compared with that of nontransgenic littermates. These findings suggest that the mTOR-mediated signaling pathway is not essential to cardiac hypertrophic growth but is involved in regulating cardiac function. Additional analysis of cardiac responses to fasting-refeeding or acute insulin administration indicated that \u03b1MHC-mTORkd mice had a largely impaired physiological response to nutrient energy supply and insulin stimulation. \u00a9 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

Relative warps analysis revealed the main trends in morphological variation to be associated with the width, length and shape of the V-rib, while the proximal border region was found to be more stable. Almost all of the scales investigated were successfully differentiated and assigned to an individual species by means of multivariate statistics, the classification experiments were done in a pairwise manner. Geometric morphometric based analyses did not corroborate the classification of these species into traditionally defined sections. M. kalinae and M. striata were found to be the most similar, although they are classified into different sections of the genus, while M. kalinae and M. calceolus that are both traditionally classified as belonging to the section Papillosae, proved to be the most dissimilar species pair. \u00a9 Nordic Journal of Botany 2008."

A key observation was that physical interaction between eIF4E and the VPg is required for viral infection, and eIF4E mutations that cause resistance prevent VPg binding and inhibit the viral cycle. In this study, polymorphism analysis of the pvr2-eIF4E coding sequence in a worldwide sample of 25 C. annuum accessions identified 10 allelic variants with exclusively non-synonymous variations clustered in two surface loops of eIF4E. Resistance and genetic complementation assays demonstrated that pvr2 variants, each with signature amino acid changes, corresponded to potyvirus resistance alleles. Systematic analysis of the interactions between eIF4E proteins encoded by the 10 pvr2 alleles and VPgs of virulent and avirulent potato virus Y (PVY) and tobacco etch virus (TEV) strains demonstrated that resistance phenotypes arose from disruption of the interaction between eIF4E and VPg, and that viral adaptation to eIF4E-mediated resistance resulted from restored interaction with the resistance protein. Complementation of an eIF4E knockout yeast strain by C. annuum eIF4E proteins further shows that amino acid changes did not impede essential eIF4E functions. Altogether, these results argue in favour of a co-evolutionary 'arms race' between Capsicum eIF4E and potyviral VPg. \u00a9 2008 The Authors."

Medicinal plants have been employed in dentistry since prehistoric times in different societies for both therapeutic and preventive oral health care. The various applications of phytomedicines for dental health and healing were explored through a survey of 91 medicinal plant shops in Miami, Florida, original research results from the Caribbean, and a review of published cross-cultural evidence. Anecdotal informant reports, case-study field data, clinical research trials, and biochemical laboratory tests all indicate that botanical medicines represent an historically effective and promising complementary approach to dental health maintenance, therapy, and support. Botanical remedies have proven effective in the treatment and management of a variety of oral disorders, partly due to the action of beneficial phytochemicals they contain. Contraindications and potentially negative side effects have also been recorded in the safety profiles for several of the medicinal plants."

CVC and CLS occur sympatrically and share leafhopper vectors; thus, determining whether X. fastidiosa isolates can be dispersed from one crop to another and cause disease is of epidemiological importance. We sought to clarify the genetic and biological relationships between CVC- and CLS-causing X. fastidiosa isolates. We used cross-inoculation bioassays and microsatellite and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approaches to determine the host range and genetic structure of 26 CVC and 20 CLS isolates collected from different regions in Brazil. Our results show that citrus and coffee X. fastidiosa isolates are biologically distinct. Cross-inoculation tests showed that isolates causing CVC and CLS in the field were able to colonize citrus and coffee plants, respectively, but not the other host, indicating biological isolation between the strains. The microsatellite analysis separated most X. fastidiosa populations tested on the basis of the host plant from which they were isolated. However, recombination among isolates was detected and a lack of congruency among phylogenetic trees was observed for the loci used in the MLST scheme. Altogether, our study indicates that CVC and CLS are caused by two biologically distinct strains of X. fastidiosa that have diverged but are genetically homogenized by frequent recombination.

In addition, the influence of reproductive costs on floral longevity responses to pollen addition and/or removal has not yet been evaluated. Here, the orchid Cohniella ascendens is used to answer the following questions. (a) Does experimental removal of flower buds in C. ascendens increase flower longevity? (b) Does pollen addition and/or removal decrease floral longevity, and does this response depend on plant reproductive resource status? \u2022 Methods: To study the effect of reproductive costs on floral longevity 21 plants were selected from which we removed 50% of the developing flower buds on a marked inflorescence. Another 21 plants were not manipulated (controls). One month later, one of four flowers on each marked inflorescence received one of the following pollen manipulation treatments: control, pollinia removal, pollination without pollinia removal or pollination with pollinia removal. The response variable measured was the number of days each flower remained open (i.e. longevity). \u2022 Key Results: The results showed significant flower bud removal and pollen manipulation effects on floral longevity; the interaction between these two factors was not significant. Flowers on inflorescences with previously removed flower buds remained open significantly longer than flowers on control inflorescences. On the other hand, pollinated flowers closed much faster than control and removed-pollinia flowers, the latter not closing significantly faster than control flowers, although this result was marginal. \u2022 Conclusions: The results emphasize the strong relationship between floral longevity and pollination in orchids, as well as the influence of reproductive costs on the former. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

A., and Lamb, C. (2004) EMBO J. 23, 980-988). This apoplastic enzyme is a member of the group of \"atypical\" plant aspartic proteinases. As for other enzymes of this subtype, CDR1 has remained elusive until recently as a result of its unusual properties and localization. Here we report on the heterologous expression and characterization of recombinant CDR1, which displays unique enzymatic properties among plant aspartic proteinases. The highly restricted specificity requirements, insensitivity toward the typical aspartic proteinase inhibitor pepstatin A, an unusually high optimal pH of 6.0-6.5, proteinase activity without irreversible prosegment removal, and dependence of catalytic activity on formation of a homo-dimer are some of the unusual properties observed for recombinant CDR1. These findings unveil a pattern of unprecedented functional complexity for Arabidopsis CDR1 and are consistent with a highly specific and regulated biological function. \u00a9 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

Both the maximum photosynthetic rate (P*max) and maximum light utilization coefficient (\u03b1*) were lower at stations within the eddy as compared with those in the continental shelf-slope area and the offshore area. The low-density water mass of the eddy prevented the upward and horizontal supply of macronutrients and micronutrients, which likely resulted in a reduction of P*max and \u03b1*. In contrast, both P*max and \u03b1* were large and variable in the slope area, probably owing to a local stability resulting from the less-saline surface water. The present study indicates the possibility that longitudinal variations in the latitudinal pattern of meanders, eddies, seasonal sea-ice extent, and topographical conditions significantly influence the mesoscale variations in the P-E parameters and primary production in the Southern Ocean.

Morphological data suggest that tepal-derived petals have evolved independently in the major lineages of the core eudicots (i.e. asterids, Santalales and rosids) from Berberidopsis-like prototypes, and that staminodial petals have arisen only in few isolated cases where petals had been previously lost (Caryophyllales, Rosales). The clear correlation between continuous changes in petal morphology, and a scenario that indicates numerous duplications to have taken place in genes controlling floral organ development, can only be fully understood within a phylogenetic context. B-gene expression plays a fundamental role in the evolution of the petals by controlling petaloidy, but it does not clarify petal homology. \u2022 Conclusions: An increased synorganization of the flower in the core eudicots linked with the establishment of floral whorls restricts the petaloid gene expression to the second whorl, reducing the similarities of petals with tepals from which they were originally derived. An increased flower size linked with secondary polyandry or polycarpelly may lead to a breakdown of the restricted gene expression and a reversal to ancestral characteristics of perianth development. An altered 'sliding boundary' hypothesis is proposed for the core eudicots to explain shifts in petaloidy of the perianth and the event of staminodial petals. The repetitive changes of function in the perianth of the core eudicots are linked with shifts in petaloidy to the outer perianth whorl, or losses of petal or sepal whorls that can be secondarily compensated for by the inclusion of bracts in the flower. The origin and evolution of petals appears to be as complex on a molecular basis as it is from a morphological point of view. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

This study aimed to investigate the role of one key MMR gene in recombination. We obtained a mutant line in which the AtMLH1 gene has been disrupted by the insertion of a T-DNA within the coding region. Transcript analysis indicated that no full-length transcript was produced in mutant plants. The loss of a functional AtMLH1 gene led to a significant reduction in fertility in both homozygotes and heterozygotes, and we observed a strong bias against transmission of the mutant allele. To investigate the role of AtMLH1 in mitotic recombination, the mutant was crossed to a series of recombination reporter lines. A strong decrease (72%) in the frequency of homologous recombination was observed in the mutant. However, the decline in recombination due to homeology was less severe in the Atmlh1 mutant than in a wild-type control. These data demonstrate a dual role for AtMLH1 in recombination: it is both required for recombination and acts to limit recombination between diverged sequences. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

Katanin p60, one of the two subunits, possesses ATPase and MT-binding/ severing activities, and the p 80 subunit is responsible for targeting of katanin to certain subcellular locations. In animals, katanin plays an important role in the release of MTs from their nucleation sites in the centrosome. It is also involved in severing MTs into smaller fragments which can serve as templates for further polymerization to increase MT number during meiotic and mitotic spindle assembly. Katanin homologs are present in a wide variety of plant species. The Arabidopsis katanin homolog has been shown to possess ATP-dependent MT severing activity in vitro and exhibit a punctate localization pattern at the cell cortex and the perinuclear region. Disruption of katanin functions by genetic mutations causes a delay in the disappearance of the perinuclear MT array and results in an aberrant organization of cortical MTs in elongating cells. Consequently, katanin mutations lead to defects in cell elongation, cellulose microfibril deposition, and hormonal responses. Studies of katanin in plants provide new insights into our understanding of its roles in cellular functions. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences."

An investigation was therefore carried out into the origin and a possible scenario for the rise of a sterile plant clone showing a combination of diagnostic morphological features of three separate, well-defined Potamogeton species. \u2022 Methods: The combination of sequences from maternally inherited cytoplasmic (rpl20-rps12) and biparentally inherited nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) was used to identify the exact identity of the putative triple hybrid. \u2022 Key Results: Direct sequencing showed ITS variants of three parental taxa, P. gramineus, P. lucens and P. perfoliatus, whereas chloroplast DNA identified P. perfoliatus as the female parent. A scenario for the rise of the triple hybrid through a fertile binary hybrid P. gramineus x P. lucens crossed with P. perfoliatus is described. \u2022 Conclusions: Even though the triple hybrid is sterile, it possesses an efficient strategy for its existence and became locally successful even in the parental environment, perhaps as a result of heterosis. The population investigated is the only one known of this hybrid, P. x torssanderi, worldwide. Isozyme analysis indicated the colony to be genetically uniform. The plants studied represented a single clone that seems to have persisted at this site for a long time. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

            "text": "\u2022 Background and Aims: Although individual plants exhibit much complex behaviour in response to environmental stimuli, they appear to do so without any identifiable centres of organization. We review a special class of model with the aim of testing whether plants can effectively be self-assembling, modular-driven organisms, in the sense that whole-plant organization and behaviour emerges solely from the interactions of much smaller structural elements. We also review evidence that still higher-level behaviour, at the population and community levels of organization, can emerge from this same source. \u2022 Methods: In previous work we devised a special cellular automaton (CA) model of plant growth. This comprises a section depicting a two-dimensional plant in its above- and below-ground environments. The whole plant is represented by branching structures made up from identical 'modules'. The activity of these modules is driven by morphological, physiological and reproductive rulesets derived from comparative plant ecology, a feature which lends itself to experimentation at several ecological scales. \u2022 Key Results: From real experiments using virtual plants we show that the model can reproduce a very wide range of whole-plant-, population- and community-level behaviour. All of these properties emerge successfully from a ruleset acting only at the level of the CA module. \u2022 Conclusions: The CA model can, with advantage, be driven by C-S-R plant strategy theory. As this theory can ascribe a functional classification to any temperate angiosperm on the basis of a few simple tests, any community of such plants can be redescribed in terms of its 'functional signature' and the net environment that it experiences. To a valuable first approximation, therefore, a C-S-R version of the CA model can simulate the most essential properties both of natural vegetation and of its environment. We have thus achieved a position from which we can test a plethora of high-level community processes, such as diversity, vulnerability, resistance, resilience, stability, and habitat-community heterogeneity - processes which, if investigated on the scales truly required for a full understanding, would fall beyond the practical scope of even the largest real-life investigation. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

Seed-borne infections are the primary sources of inoculum for SMV infections. The strain specificity of SMV transmission through seed and SMV-induced seed-coat mottling were investigated in field experiments. Six soybean plant introductions (PIs) were inoculated with eight SMV strains and isolates. Transmission of SMV through seed ranged from 0 to 43%, and isolate-by-soybean line interactions occurred in both transmission rates and percentages of mottled seeds. For example, SMV 746 was transmitted through 43% of seed in PI 229324, but was not transmitted through seed of PIs 68522, 68671, or 86449. In contrast, SMV 413 was transmitted through seed from all PIs. SMVs that were transmitted poorly by the Asian soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, also were transmitted poorly through seed. No predicted amino acid sequences within the helper-component protease or coat protein coding regions differentiated the two groups of SMV strains. The loss of aphid and seed transmissibility by repeated mechanical transmission suggests that constant selection pressure is needed to maintain the regions of the SMV genome controlling the two phenotypes from genetic drift and loss of function."

In its native habitat (southern Africa) this species has been reported as heterostylous with trimorphic flowers and a self- and morph-incompatible reproductive system. In most of the areas invaded, only a pentaploid short-styled morphotype that reproduces mainly asexually by bulbils is reported, but this has only been confirmed empirically. This study aims to analyse the floral morph proportions in a wide distribution area, test the sexual female success, and explain the causes of low sexual reproduction of this species in the western area of the Mediterranean Basin. \u2022 Methods: Fifty-five populations of O. pes-caprae were sampled in the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco to evaluate the floral morph ratio and individual fruit set. In plants from a dimorphic population, hand-pollination experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of the pollen source on pollen tube growth through the style. The ploidy level and genome size of individuals of each floral morph were analysed using flow cytometry. \u2022 Key Results: From the populations studied 89.1 % were monomorphic, with most of them containing the short-styled (SS) floral morph, and 10.9 % were dimorphic containing long-styled (LS) and SS morphs. In some of these, isoplethy was verified but no fruit production was observed in any population. A sterile form was also recorded in several populations. Hand-pollination experiments revealed that pollen grains germinated over recipient stigmas. In intermorph crossings, pollen tubes were able to develop and fruit initiation was observed in some cases, while in intramorph pollinations, pollen tube development was sporadic and no fruit initiation was observed. All individuals within each floral form presented the same DNA ploidy level: SS plants were pentaploid and LS and the sterile form were tetraploid. \u2022 Conclusions: The low or null sexual reproduction success of this species in the area of invasion studied seems related with the high frequency of monomorphic populations, the unequal proportion of floral morphs in dimorphic populations and the presence of different ploidy levels between SS and LS morphs. The discovery of the occurrence of an LS floral morph and a sterile form, whose invading capacity in these areas is as yet unknown, will be valuable information for management programmes. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

When a root ball is smaller than a container, the amount of plant-available water (PAW) is initially limited to that of the original root ball. With growth, roots colonize new substrate and thereby increase the volume of water available to a shoot. Because of hydraulic gradients in container substrates, PAW is not linearly proportional to the volume of substrate occupied by roots. To practice precision irrigation in nursery production, it is important to know the extent of PAW and how it changes with growth. A method is detailed that calculates in situ PAW in containers based on changes in actual evapotranspiration while irrigation is withheld. The method is applied under field conditions and requires only daily mass loss measurements and corresponding reference evapotranspiration. An example of how PAW changes during production from rooted cuttings to marketable size plants is provided."

We show that the density and development of stomatal complexes on the epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves depend, in part, on the microRNA-mediated regulation of Agamous-like16 (AGL16), which is a member of the MADS box protein family. AGL16 mRNA is targeted for sequence-specific degradation by miR824, a recently evolved microRNA conserved in the Brassicaceae and encoded at a single genetic locus. Primary stomatal complexes can give rise to higher-order complexes derived from satellite meristemoids. Expression of a miR824-resistant AGL16 mRNA, but not the wild-type AGL16 mRNA, in transgenic plants increased the incidence of stomata in higher-order complexes. By contrast, reduced expression of AGL16 mRNA in the agl16-1 deficiency mutant and in transgenic lines overexpressing miR824 decreased the incidence of stomata in higher-order complexes. These findings and the nonoverlapping patterns of AGL16 mRNA and miR824 localization led us to propose that the miR824/AGL16 pathway functions in the satellite meristemoid lineage of stomatal development. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

Seed priming, which can break dormancy and accelerate germination, can also reduce seed storage life. Because primed seeds were not used in developing the Ellis-Roberts equation, the reciprocal nature of specific seed moisture content (MC, fresh weight basis) and temperatures that applies to nonprimed lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds may not apply to primed seeds. To determine how priming affects lettuce seeds in relation to the viability equation, an experiment was conducted using two cultivars, 'Big Ben' and 'Parris Island Cos'. Seeds primed in polyethylene glycol 8000 (-1.45 MPa, 24 h at 15\u00b0C) and nonprimed seeds were first adjusted to 6% and 9% moisture contents and then stored at 48 and 38\u00b0C for up to 30 days, respectively. These storage conditions (6% MC and 48\u00b0C; 9% MC and 38\u00b0C) were predicted by the viability equation to result in equal longevities. Subsequent viability assays at 20\u00b0C revealed that nonprimed seeds in both storage environments exhibited similar losses in viability over time, thus validating the Ellis-Roberts equation and the use of these conditions to apply different but equal aging stress. Primed seeds of both cultivars deteriorated faster than nonprimed seeds as expected. However, primed seeds did exhibit different rates of deterioration between the storage environments. Primed seeds stored at 9% MC and 38\u00b0C deteriorated faster than primed seeds stored at 6% MC and 48\u00b0C. The rate of decline in probit viability percentage was three times greater in primed 'Big Ben' seeds stored at 9% MC and 38\u00b0C than for those stored at 6% MC and 48\u00b0C (-1.34 versus -0.26 probits per day, respectively). 'Parris Island Cos' seeds stored at 9% MC and 38\u00b0C had twice the rate of deterioration that those stored at 6% MC and 48\u00b0C (-1.19 and -0.49 probits per day, respectively). The results indicate that primed lettuce seeds were more sensitive to the adverse effects of higher seed MC than were nonprimed seeds during storage at elevated temperatures."

We show that the RING finger E3 ligase, Arabidopsis thaliana SALT- AND DROUGHT-INDUCED RING FINGER1 (SDIR1), is involved in abscisic acid (ABA)-related stress signal transduction. SDIR1 is expressed in all tissues of Arabidopsis and is upregulated by drought and salt stress, but not by ABA. Plants expressing the ProSDIR1-\u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter construct confirmed strong induction of GUS expression in stomatal guard cells and leaf mesophyll cells under drought stress. The green fluorescent protein-SDIR1 fusion protein is colocalized with intracellular membranes. We demonstrate that SDIR1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and that the RING finger conservation region is required for its activity. Overexpression of SDIR1 leads to ABA hypersensitivity and ABA-associated phenotypes, such as salt hypersensitivity in germination, enhanced ABA-induced stomatal closing, and enhanced drought tolerance. The expression levels of a number of key ABA and stress marker genes are altered both in SDIR1 overexpression and sdir1-1 mutant plants. Cross-complementation experiments showed that the ABA-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), ABRE BINDING FACTOR3 (ABF3), and ABF4 genes can rescue the ABA-insensitive phenotype of the sdir1-1 mutant, whereas SDIR1 could not rescue the abi5-1 mutant. This suggests that SDIR1 acts upstream of those basic leucine zipper family genes. Our results indicate that SDIR1 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

Maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) have additional types of axillary meristems in the inflorescence compared to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and thus provide an excellent model system to study axillary meristem initiation. Previously, we characterized the barren inflorescence2 (bif2) mutant in maize and showed that bif2 plays a key role in axillary meristem and lateral primordia initiation in the inflorescence. In this article, we cloned bif2 by transposon tagging. Isolation of bif2-like genes fromseven other grasses, along with phylogenetic analysis, showed that bif2 is a co-ortholog of PINOID (PID), which regulates auxin transport in Arabidopsis. Expression analysis showed that bif2 is expressed in all axillary meristems and lateral primordia during inflorescence and vegetative development in maize and rice. Further phenotypic analysis of bif2 mutants in maize illustrates additional roles of bif2 during vegetative development. We propose that bif2/PID sequence and expression are conserved between grasses and Arabidopsis, attesting to the important role they play in development. We provide further support that bif2, and by analogy PID, is required for initiation of both axillary meristems and lateral primordia. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

The amplitude of this effect differs between accessions, with Columbia-0 (Col-0) showing a large response, while in Landsberg erecta (Ler), hyponastic growth is minimal. Abscisic acid (ABA) was found to act as an inhibitory factor of this response in both accessions, but the relationship between ethylene and ABA differed between the two; the ability of ABA to inhibit ethylene-induced hyponasty was significantly more pronounced in Col-0. Mutations in ABI1 or ABI3 induced a strong ethylene-regulated hyponastic growth in the less responsive accession Ler, while the response was abolished in the ABA-hypersensitive era1 in Col-0. Modifications in ABA levels altered petiole angles in the absence of applied ethylene, indicating that ABA influences petiole angles also independently from ethylene. A model is proposed whereby the negative effect of ABA on hyponastic growth is overcome by ethylene in Col-0 but not in Ler. However, when ABA signaling is artificially released in Ler, this regulatory mechanism is bypassed, resulting in a strong hyponastic response in this accession. \u00a9 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists."

Each was irrigated with a solution containing 2 CaCl2 :1 NaCl (M ratio) at salinity levels of 0 (control), 1000, 3000, and 5000 mg\u00b7L-1 during two 8-week experiments. They measured weekly visual quality and gas exchange and final shoot and root dry weights. Mirabilis multiflora, L. xsuperbum, and L. angustifolia maintained high visual quality and 100% survival across salinity levels. However, dry weights for L. xsuperbum decreased at salt levels \u2265 3000 mg\u00b7L-1 in both experiments and for L. angustifolia in one experiment. Mortality rates of 12% to 100% were observed for the remaining five species irrigated with 3000 and 5000-mg\u00b7L-1 solutions. Visual quality of P. palmeri, G. viscosissimum, and E. purpurea varied with time of year the experiment was conducted, with low visual quality associated with high temperatures and light intensities, whereas dry matter and gas exchange responses to salinity were similar between the two experiments. Penstemon xmexicali and E. jamesii exhibited high mortality, low visual quality, and low gas exchange in the case of E. jamesii at high salinity treatments regardless of when experiments were conducted. Based on visual quality responses, M. multiflora, L. xsuperbum, and L. angustifolia are relatively more salt tolerant, and P. xmexicali and E. jamesii are relatively more intolerant, than the three other species. Penstemon palmeri, G. viscosissimum, and E. purpurea exhibited intermediate tolerance to salinity with acceptable quality during periods of cool temperatures and lower light intensities."

The photosynthetic response data was fitted to a non-rectangular hyperbola model. The estimated parameters were compared for effects of moisture deficit and elevated CO2 concentration (EC). The carboxylation efficiency (\u03b1) increased in response to mild moisture stress (-30 kPa) under EC when compared to the unstressed control. However, moderate (-55 kPa) and extreme (-70 kPa) moisture deficits reduced \u03b1 under EC. Maximum net photosynthetic rate (PNmax) did not differ between mild water deficit and unstressed controls under EC. Moderate and extreme moisture deficits reduced P Nmax by nearly 85 % compared to controls. Dark respiration rate (RD) showed no consistent response to moisture deficit. The CO 2 compensation concentration (\u0393) was 324 \u03bcmol mol -1 for -75 kPa and ranged 63-93 \u03bcmol mol-1 for other moisture regimes. Interaction between moisture deficit and EC was noticed for PN, ratio of intercellular and ambient CO2 concentration (Ci/Ca), stomatal conductance (gs ), and transpiration rate (E). PN was maximum and Ci/C a was minimum at -30 kPa moisture deficit and at Ca of 350 \u03bcmol mol-1. The gs and E showed an inverse relationship at all moisture deficit regimes and EC. Water use efficiency (WUE) increased with moisture deficit up to -55 kPa and declined thereafter. EC showed a positive influence towards sustaining PN and increasing WUE only under mild moisture stress, and no beneficial effects of EC were noticed at moderate or extreme moisture deficits. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Experimental Botany, ASCR."

Water stress significantly decreased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) in both jasmine genotypes, but increased minimum fluorescence (F0) only in DP-jasmine. Water stress also decreased starch content, while increased contents of total soluble sugars and proline in leaves of both genotypes. SP-jasmine demonstrated higher drought tolerance as evidenced by maintaining higher gas exchange and photochemical efficiency and lower alteration of metabolites than DP-jasmine. Recovery analysis revealed that drought-induced injury in photosynthetic machinery in jasmine plants was reversible. DP-jasmine exhibited a slow recovery of drought-induced impairment in photosynthetic activity and associated metabolites, suggesting that this genotype had lower capacity to adapt to water limited condition. Higher yield stability of SP-than that of DP-jasmine under rain-fed condition finally confirmed higher drought tolerance of SP-jasmine. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Experimental Botany, ASCR."

The optimal level of TDZ supplementation to the culture medium was 50 \u03bcM for 8 d induction period followed by subculturing in MS medium devoid of TDZ as it produced maximum regeneration frequency (78 %), mean number of shoots (11.6 \u00b1 1.16) and shoot length (4.8 \u00b1 0.43 cm) per explant. A culture period longer than 8 d with TDZ resulted in the formation of fasciated or distorted shoots. The regenerated shoots rooted best on MS medium containing 1.0 \u03bcM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The micropropagated shoots with well developed roots were successfully established in pots containing garden soil and grown in greenhouse with 95 % survival rate.

In Arabidopsis the first proposed regulatory transcriptional loop involved the transcription factors CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and the pseudo-response regulator TIMING OF CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN (TOC1/PRR1). Recent findings indicate that the TOC1 homologues PRR7 and PRR9 might also be involved in transcriptional regulatory loops with CCA1 and LHY. In this study we show that the overexpression of PRR7 in Arabidopsis leads to severely compromised circadian rhythms. These transgenic lines display significantly reduced levels of CCA1 and LHY RNA, providing further evidence for a transcriptional feedback loop between PRR7 and these transcription factors. In addition, we show that the PRR7 protein is phosphorylated in a circadian regulated manner and that its levels are post-translationally regulated by both diurnal and circadian mechanisms. The Arabidopsis circadian oscillator is therefore likely to be entrained to light/dark cycles both through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

            "text": "\u2022 Background and Aims: After the initial boom in the application of flow cytometry in plant sciences in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which was accompanied by development of many nuclear isolation buffers, only a few efforts were made to develop new buffer formulas. In this work, recent data on the performance of nuclear isolation buffers are utilized in order to develop new buffers, general purpose buffer (GPB) and woody plant buffer (WPB), for plant DNA flow cytometry. \u2022 Methods: GPB and WPB were used to prepare samples for flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content in a set of 37 plant species that included herbaceous and woody taxa with leaf tissues differing in structure and chemical composition. The following parameters of isolated nuclei were assessed: forward and side light scatter, propidium iodide fluorescence, coefficient of variation of DNA peaks, quantity of debris background, and the number of particles released from sample tissue. The nuclear genome size of 30 selected species was also estimated using the buffer that performed better for a given species. \u2022 Key Results: In unproblematic species, the use of both buffers resulted in high quality samples. The analysis of samples obtained with GPB usually resulted in histograms of DNA content with higher or similar resolution than those prepared with the WPB. In more recalcitrant tissues, such as those from woody plants, WPB performed better and GPB failed to provide acceptable results in some cases. Improved resolution of DNA content histograms in comparison with previously published buffers was achieved in most of the species analysed. \u2022 Conclusions: WPB is a reliable buffer which is also suitable for the analysis of problematic tissues/species. Although GPB failed with some plant species, it provided high-quality DNA histograms in species from which nuclear suspensions are easy to prepare. The results indicate that even with a broad range of species, either GPB or WPB is suitable for preparation of high-quality suspensions of intact nuclei suitable for DNA flow cytometry. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

Under high irradiance, salinity had no significant effect on the intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration ratio (C i/C a). However, during photosynthesis under limiting irradiance, the maximum quantum efficiency of CO2 fixation decreased under salinity across species, suggesting there is increased leakage of the CO2 delivered to the bundle sheath cells by the C4 pump. Growth under salinity did not affect the maximum intrinsic efficiency of photosystem 2, PS2 (FV/FM) in these species, suggesting salinity had no effect on photosynthesis by inactivation of PS2 reaction centers. Under saline conditions and high irradiance, P N was reduced by 75 % in Spartina patens and S. alterniflora, whereas salinity had no effect on P N in S. densiflora or D. spicata. This inhibition of P N in S. patens and S. alterniflora was not due to an effect on stomatal conductance since the ratio of C i/C a did not decrease under saline conditions. In growth with and without salt, P N was saturated at \u223c500 \u03bcmol(quantum) m-2 s-1 while J O2 continued to increase up to full sunlight, indicating that carbon assimilation was not tightly coupled to photochemistry in these halophytic species. This increase in alternative electron flow under high irradiance might be an inherent function in these halophytes for dissipating excess energy. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Experimental Botany, ASCR."

Overexpression of BEN1 greatly enhances the defective phenotypes of bri1-5 plants. Removal of BEN1 by gene disruption in a Col-0 wild-type background, on the other hand, promotes the elongation of organs. Because BEN1 encodes a novel protein homologous to dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin reductase (BAN), BEN1 is probably involved in a brassinosteroid metabolic pathway. Analyses of brassinosteroid profiles demonstrated that BEN1 is indeed responsible for regulating the levels of several brassinosteroids, including typhasterol, castasterone and brassinolide. In vivo feeding and in vitro biochemical assays suggest that BEN1 is probably involved in a new mechanism to regulate brassinosteroid levels. These results provide additional insight into the regulatory mechanisms of bioactive brassinosteroids. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

The geometries and the relative stabilities of the trans and cis isomers were investigated within density functional theory (DFT) as well as within Hartree-Fock (HF), second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset (MP2), and coupled cluster (CC) theories. The DFT calculations were performed using the B3LYP and PBE functionals, with basis sets of different qualities, and gave results that are very consistent with each other. The molecular structure is thus predicted to be planar at the energy minimum, which is associated with the trans conformation, and to become markedly twisted at the minimum of higher energy, which is associated with the cis conformation. The results of the calculations performed with the post-HF methods approach those obtained with the DFT methods, provided that the level of treatment of the electronic correlation is high enough and that sufficiently flexible basis sets are used. Calculations carried out within DFT also allowed the determination of the geometry and the energy of the molecule at the biradicaloid transition state associated with the thermal cis=trans isomerization and at the transition states associated with the enantiomerization of the cis isomer and with the rotations of the pyridinyl and phenyl groups in the trans and cis isomers. Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations were also performed at 50, 150, and 300K using the PBE functional. The studies allowed us to evidence the highly flexible nature of the molecule in both conformations. In particular, the trans isomer was found to exist mainly in a nonplanar form at finite temperatures, while the rotation of the pyridinyl ring in the cis isomer was incidentally observed to take place within \u2248 1 ps during the simulation carried out at 150K on this isomer. \u00a9 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The class 1 KNOX genes encode homeodomain transcription factors that function variously in the establishment and maintenance of the SAM, and have also been implicated in carpel development. Here we show that the KNOX gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) induces carpel formation and promotes homeotic conversion of ovules to carpels when ectopically expressed in flowers, as previously reported for the related gene KNAT2. In contrast to KNAT2, loss of which confers no phenotype, we show using inducible RNA interference and mutational analysis that progressive loss of STM causes floral phenotypes ranging from reduced formation of placental tissues and inhibited carpel fusion to complete loss of carpel development. These effects result neither from failure to establish the central stem cell niche nor from reduced floral homeotic gene expression, but rather indicate a specific requirement for STM in carpel initiation, as further supported by the loss of leafy carpelloid features in stm leafy double mutants. Activation of carpel development by STM is independent of LEAFY and WUSCHEL, but requires the function of AGAMOUS. The essential role for STM in carpel development, together with its previous reported role in the SAM, shows that, despite the existence of several partially redundant paralogous genes, STM provides the critical KNOX function in the development of both vegetative and reproductive meristematic tissues. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

            "text": "\u2022 Background and Aims: When ecologically important plant traits are correlated they may be said to constitute an ecological 'strategy' dimension. Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter-relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits, and thus the strategy dimensions they represented, across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests. \u2022 Methods: Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA), the average size of leaves, seed and fruit, typical maximum plant height, and wood density (WD). Trait relationships were quantified across species at each individual forest as well as across the dataset as a whole. 'Phylogenetic' analyses were used to test for correlations among evolutionary trait-divergences and to ascertain whether interspecific relationships were biased by strong taxonomic patterning in the traits. \u2022 Key Results: The interspecific and phylogenetic analyses yielded congruent results. Seed and fruit size were expected, and confirmed, to be tightly related. As expected, plant height was correlated with each of seed and fruit size, albeit weakly. Weak support was found for an expected positive relationship between leaf and fruit size. The prediction that SLA and WD would be negatively correlated was not supported. Otherwise the traits were predicted to be largely unrelated, being representatives of putatively independent strategy dimensions. This was indeed the case, although WD was consistently, negatively related to leaf size. \u2022 Conclusions: The dimensions represented by SLA, seed/fruit size and leaf size were essentially independent and thus conveyed largely independent information about plant strategies. To a lesser extent the same was true for plant height and WD. Our tentative explanation for negative WD-leaf size relationships, now also known from other habitats, is that the traits are indirectly linked via plant hydraulics. \u00a9 The Author 2006.

The goal of this study was to identify transporters involved in the uptake of amino acids into root cells. Based on the fact that high concentrations of amino acids inhibit plant growth, we hypothesized that mutants tolerating toxic levels of amino acids might be deficient in the uptake of amino acids from the environment. To test this hypothesis, we employed a forward genetic screen for Arabidopsis thaliana mutants tolerating toxic concentrations of amino acids in the media. We identified an Arabidopsis mutant that is deficient in the amino acid permease 1 (AAP1, At1g58360) and resistant to 10 mm phenylalanine and a range of other amino acids. The transporter was localized to the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells, root hairs, and throughout the root tip of Arabidopsis. Feeding experiments with [14C]-labeled neutral, acidic and basic amino acids showed significantly reduced uptake of amino acids in the mutant, underscoring that increased tolerance of aap1 to high levels of amino acids is coupled with reduced uptake by the root. The growth and uptake studies identified glutamate, histidine and neutral amino acids, including phenylalanine, as physiological substrates for AAP1, whereas aspartate, lysine and arginine are not. We also demonstrate that AAP1 imports amino acids into root cells when these are supplied at ecologically relevant concentrations. Together, our data indicate an important role of AAP1 for efficient use of nitrogen sources present in the rhizosphere. \u00a9 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Indeed, plants sense numerous environmental cues and respond via appropriate tropisms, and it is widely accepted that auxin plays an important role in these responses. Recent analyses using Arabidopsis have emphasized the importance of polar auxin transport and differential auxin responses to gravitropism. Even so, the involvement of auxin in hydrotropism remains unclear. To clarify whether or not auxin is involved in the hydrotropic response, Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with inhibitors of auxin influx (3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), efflux (1-naphthylphthalemic acid and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid), and response (p-chlorophenoxyisobutylacetic acid), and their effects were examined on both hydrotropic and gravitropic responses. In agreement with previous reports, gravitropism was inhibited by all the chemicals tested. By contrast, only an inhibitor of the auxin response (p-chlorophenoxyisobutylacetic acid) reduced hydrotropism, whereas inhibitors for influx or efflux of auxin had no effect. These results suggest that auxin response, apart from its polar transport, plays a definite role in hydrotropic response, and will evoke a new concept for the auxin-mediated regulation of tropisms. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s)."

In 2004 and 2005, 107 and 22 lettuce cultivars, respectively, were screened for resistance in a field infested with Verticillium dahliae, and disease progress on resistant and susceptible cultivars was determined. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate 16 cultivars for resistance to a race 1 and a race 2 isolate. Significant differences for resistance were observed within cultivated lettuce. In susceptible cultivars, disease levels increased through the season, whereas disease in resistant cultivars remained constant. Resistance in greenhouse tests was dependant upon the race used. Seven cultivars were resistant to race 1, whereas all were susceptible to race 2. Cultivar reactions to race 1 in greenhouse and field experiments were correlated, indicating the utility of greenhouse evaluations. The identification of resistance in diverse lettuce types is beneficial to the breeding process. However, because of the existence of resistance-breaking race 2 isolates, this resistance may not be durable. Alternatively, targeted releases of race-1-resistant cultivars to fields with only race 1 pathogen genotypes may extend the life of these cultivars."

To allow analyzing of gene proteomic annotations, we implemented novel modules within GFINDer, a Web system we previously developed that dynamically aggregates functional and phenotypic annotations of user-uploaded gene lists and allows performing their statistical analysis and mining. Results: Exploiting protein information in Pfam and InterPro databanks, we developed and added in GFINDer original modules specifically devoted to the exploration and analysis of functional signatures of gene protein products. They allow annotating numerous user-classified nucleotide sequence identifiers with controlled information on related protein families, domains and functional sites, classifying them according to such protein annotation categories, and statistically analyzing the obtained classifications. In particular, when uploaded nucleotide sequence identifiers are subdivided in classes, the Statistics Protein Families&Domains module allows estimating relevance of Pfam or InterPro controlled annotations for the uploaded genes by highlighting protein signatures significantly more represented within user-defined classes of genes. In addition, the Logistic Regression module allows identifying protein functional signatures that better explain the considered gene classification. Conclusion: Novel GFINDer modules provide genomic protein family and domain analyses supporting better functional interpretation of gene classes, for instance defined through statistical and clustering analyses of gene expression results from microarray experiments. They can hence help understanding fundamental biological processes and complex cellular mechanisms influenced by protein domain composition, and contribute to unveil new biomedical knowledge about the codifying genes. \u00a9 2007 Masseroli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Plant cell immobilization offers many advantages for biotechnological processes. However, the most extended matrices employed, such as calcium-alginate, cannot fully protect entrapped cells. Sol-gel chemistry of silicates has emerged as an outstanding strategy to obtain biomaterials in which living cells are truly protected. This field of research is rapidly developing and a large number of bacteria and yeast-entrapping ceramics have already been designed for different applications. But even mild thermal and chemical conditions employed in sol-gel synthesis may result harmful to cells of higher organisms. Here we present a method for the immobilization of plant cells that allows cell growth at cavities created inside a silica matrix. Plant cell proliferation was monitored for a 6-month period, at the end of which plant calli of more than 1 mm in diameter were observed inside the inorganic host. The resulting hybrid device had good mechanical stability and proved to be an effective barrier against biological contamination, suggesting that it could be employed for long-term plant cell entrapment applications. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

P-deficient plants showed enhanced root to shoot ratio accompanied by reduced leaf area and net photosynthesis rates. Transcript profiling was performed through hybridization of nylon filter arrays spotted with cDNAs of 2,212 unigenes from a P deficiency root cDNA library. A total of 126 genes, representing different functional categories, showed significant differential expression in response to P: 62% of these were induced in P-deficient roots.

Using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, 17 TF genes were differentially expressed in P-deficient roots; four TF genes, including MYB TFs, were induced. Nonbiased metabolite profiling was used to assess the degree to which changes in gene expression in P-deficient roots affect overall metabolism. Stress-related metabolites such as polyols accumulated in P-deficient roots as well as sugars, which are known to be essential for P stress gene induction. Candidate genes have been identified that may contribute to root adaptation to P deficiency and be useful for improvement of common bean. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

The pyrolysis of whole fibers released lignin-derived products with p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl and syringyl structures. Indeed, a series of compounds having a 5-hydroxyguaiacyl nuclei, including 3-methoxycatechol, 5-vinyl-3-methoxycatechol and 5-propenyl-3-methoxycatechol, were detected and identified in all samples, although in lower amounts than the normal guaiacyl or syringyl compounds. The analysis of the lignins isolated from the same plants also showed the same 3-methoxycatechol derivatives found after whole fiber pyrolysis. These compounds are supposed to arise from the pyrolysis of 5-hydroxyguaiacyl moieties, which are supposed to be native constituents of lignin in plants forming benzodioxane substructures. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The interaction of HYL1 with DICER-LIKE1 is important for the efficient and precise processing of miRNA primary transcripts in plant miRNA biogenesis. To define the roles of the various domains of HYL1 in miRNA processing and the miRNA-directed phenotype, we transferred a series of HYL1 deletion constructs into hyl1 null mutants. The N-terminal region containing dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 completely rescued the mutant phenotype of hyl1, triggering the accumulation of miR166 and miR160 and resulting in reduced mRNA levels of the targeted genes. In vivo biochemical analysis of the HYL1-containing complexes from the transgenic plants revealed that the N-terminal dsRBDs of HYL1 were sufficient for processing miRNA precursors and the generation of mature miRNA. Transient and stable expression analysis demonstrated that the putative NLS domain was indeed the nuclear localization signal, whereas the N-terminal region containing the dsRBDs was not restricted to the nucleus. We suggest that the N-terminal dsRBDs fulfill the function of the whole HYL1 and thus play an essential role in miRNA processing and miRNA-directed silencing of targeted genes. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

Both processes are associated with diurnally regulated increases in rates of membrane water transport, which in many cases has been shown to be facilitated by aquaporins. Rhythmic leaf movements are known from many plant species, but few papers deal with the involvement of aquaporins in such movements. \u2022 Scope: Many details of the architecture and function of pulvini were worked out by Ruth Satter and co-workers using Samanea saman as a model organism. More recently a contribution of aquaporins to pulvinar movement in Samanea was demonstrated. Another model plant to study pulvinus-mediated leaf movements is Mimosa pudica. The contribution of both plasma membrane- and tonoplast-localized aquaporins to the seismonastic leaf movements in Mimosa was analysed. In tobacco, as an example of epinastic leaf movement, it was shown that a PIP1 aquaporin family member is an important component of the leaf movement mechanism. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

The 3\u2032 region of the Sho gene contains a promoter in the opposite orientation that produces a partially overlapping antisense transcript. Although Sho expression varies significantly in individual cell types, the sense and antisense transcript levels maintain a stable ratio in most tissue types. In reporter lines for the antisense promoter, we observed a change in antisense promoter activity in newly formed tissue that had been induced by prolonged culture on cytokinins or following decapitation. We interpret these data as a reflection of tissue-specific threshold levels for activation of the antisense transcript. In all tissue types tested, we detect a pool of antisense RNA of approximately 35 nt, which derives from the region where Sho sense and antisense transcripts overlap. We detect a second pool of putative dsRNA breakdown products of approximately 24 nt in all tissues tested, except roots, which are the main source of cytokinin synthesis. Our data suggest that antisense transcription can be activated in a tissue-specific manner to adjust local cytokinin synthesis via degradation of Sho dsRNA. We therefore propose that, in addition to cytokinin transport and inactivation, regulation of local cytokinin synthesis via antisense transcription represents yet another device for the complex control of local cytokinin levels in plants. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

This was approached by studying transcription and accumulation of light-harvesting complexes in wild type versus the barley mutant viridis zb63, which is depleted in photosystem I and where plastoquinone is constitutively reduced. We show that the mRNA level of genes encoding antenna proteins is almost unaffected in the mutant; this stability of messenger level is not a peculiarity of antenna-encoding genes, but it extends to all photosynthesis-related genes. In contrast, analysis of protein accumulation by two-dimensional PAGE shows that the mutant undergoes strong reduction of its antenna size, with individual gene products having different levels of accumulation. We conclude that the plastoquinone redox state plays an important role in the long term regulation of chloroplast protein expression. However, its modulation is active at the post-transcriptional rather than transcriptional level. \u00a9 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

One of the alleles, called gl3-sst, is derived from the GL3 locus, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix type transcription factor. The mutation in the gl3-sst protein modifies its ability to form a complex with the GL1 protein (a MYB transcription factor required for trichome formation), leading to changes in gene expression compared with wild type during gl3-sst mutant trichome development. The other mutant allele, sim, is a likely loss of function allele derived from the SIM locus, which is predicted to encode a negative regulator of D-type cyclin activity. The gl3-sst sim double mutant exhibits mounds of cells derived from the proliferation of single trichome precursors. The ectopic expression of a D-type cyclin gene in gl3-sst mimics the double mutant phenotype. Thus, an interaction between altered trichome gene expression caused by the gl3-sst mutation and relaxed regulation of D-type cyclin activity in the double mutant converted a non-dividing cell into a novel highly proliferating cell type. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

            "text": "One of the earliest responses of plants to environmental stress is establishing a temporary growth arrest that allows adaptation to adverse conditions. The response to abiotic stress requires the modulation of gene expression, which may be mediated by the alteration of chromatin structures. This alteration can be accomplished with the help of chromatin-remodeling enzymes, such as the various SWI/SNF classes of ATPases. Here, we investigate the role of the Arabidopsis SNF2/Brahma-type AtCHR12 chromatin-remodeling gene in plant growth and development in reaction to adverse environmental conditions. We show that the AtCHR12 chromatin-remodeling gene plays a vital role in mediating the temporary growth arrest of Arabidopsis that is induced upon perception of stress. Exposing an AtCHR12 overexpressing mutant to stress conditions leads to growth arrest of normally active primary buds, as well as to reduced growth of the primary stem. In contrast, the AtCHR12 knockout mutant shows less growth arrest than the wild-type when exposed to moderate stress. Without stress, mutant plants are indistinguishable from the wild-type, and the growth arrest response seems to depend on the severity of the stress applied. Modulation of AtCHR12 expression correlates with changes in expression of dormancy-associated genes. This is in agreement with the concept of AtCHR12 participation in priming the plants for the growth arrest response. Our data indicate that AtCHR12-associated growth arrest differs from DELLA-mediated growth restraint. This establishes AtCHR12 as a novel gene involved in the response repertoire of plants that permits flexible modulation of growth in adverse and/or otherwise limiting environments. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

Hence plants have evolved several biochemical and morphological responses to Pi starvation that both enhance uptake and conserve use. The mechanisms involved in Pi sensing and signal transduction are not completely understood. In the present study we report that a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, BHLH32, acts as a negative regulator of a range of Pi starvation-induced processes in Arabidopsis. In bhlh32 mutant plants in Pi-sufficient conditions, expression of several Pi starvation-induced genes, formation of anthocyanins, total Pi content and root hair formation were all significantly increased compared with the wild-type. Among the genes negatively regulated by BHLH32 are those encoding PPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase), which is involved in modifying metabolism so that Pi is spared. The present study has shown that PPCK genes are rapidly induced by Pi starvation leading to increased phosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Furthermore, several Arabidopsis proteins that regulate epidermal cell differentiation [TTG1 (TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1), GL3 (GLABRA3) and EGL3 (ENHANCER OF GL3)] positively regulate PPCK gene expression in response to Pi starvation. BHLH32 can physically interact with TTG1 and GL3. We propose that BHLH32 interferes with the function of TTG1-containing complexes and thereby affects several biochemical and morphological processes that respond to Pi availability. \u00a9 The Authors."

Designated AtATM1, AtAATM2, and AtATM3, these half-molecule ABC proteins are homologous to the yeast mitochondrial membrane protein ATM1 (ScATM1), which is clearly implicated in the export of mitochondrially synthesized iron/sulfur clusters. Yeast ATM1-deficient (atm1) mutants grow very slowly (have a petite phenotype), are respiration-deficient, accumulate toxic levels of iron in their mitochondria, and show enhanced compensatory high affinity iron uptake. Of the three Arabidopsis ATMs, AtATM3 bears the closest functional resemblance to ScATM1. Heterologously expressed AtATM3 is not only able to complement the yeast atm1 petite phenotype but is also able to suppress the constitutively high capacity for high affinity iron uptake associated with loss of the chromosomal copy of ScATM1, abrogate intramitochondrial iron hyperaccumulation, and restore mitochondrial respiratory function and cytochrome c levels. By comparison, AtATM1 only weakly suppresses the atm1 phenotype, and AtATM2 exerts little or no suppressive action but instead is toxic when expressed in this system. The differences between AtATM3 and AtATM1 are maintained after exchanging their target peptides, and these proteins as well as AtATM2 colocalize with the mitochondrial fluor MitoTracker Red when expressed in yeast as GFP fusions. Although its toxicity when heterologously expressed in yeast, except when fused with GFP, precludes the functional analysis of native AtATM2, a common function, mitochondrial export of Fe/S clusters or their precursors for the assembly of cytosolic Fe/S proteins, is inferred for AtATM3 and AtATM1. \u00a9 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."

To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with waterlogging tolerance at the maize seedling stage, a F2 population consisting of 288 F 2:3 lines was created from a cross between two maize genotypes, 'HZ32' (waterlogging-tolerant) and 'K12' (waterlogging-sensitive). \u2022 Methods: The F2 population was genotyped and a base-map of 1710.5 cM length was constructed with an average marker space of 11.5 cM based on 177 SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers. QTL associated with root length, root dry weight, plant height, shoot dry weight, total dry weight and waterlogging tolerance coefficient were identified via composite interval mapping (CIM) under waterlogging and control conditions in 2004 (EXP.1) and 2005 (EXP.2), respectively. \u2022 Key Results and Conclusions: Twenty-five and thirty-four QTL were detected in EXP.1 and EXP.2, respectively. The effects of each QTL were moderate, ranging from 3.9 to 37.3 %. Several major QTL determining shoot dry weight, root dry weight, total dry weight, plant height and their waterlogging tolerance coefficient each mapped on chromosomes 4 and 9. These QTL were detected consistently in both experiments. Secondary QTL influencing tolerance were also identified and located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 10. These QTL were specific to particular traits or environments. Although the detected regions need to be mapped more precisely, the findings and QTL found in this study may provide useful information for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and further genetic studies on maize waterlogging tolerance. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

            "text": "\u2022 Background and Aims: Flexistyly is a sexual dimorphism where there are two morphs that differ in the temporal expression of sexual function and also involve reciprocal movement of the stigmatic surface through a vertical axis during the flowering period. The adaptive significance of flexistyly has been interpreted as a floral mechanism for outcrossing, but it may also function to reduce sexual interference in which styles and stigmas impede the pollen export. Here these two explanations of flexistyly were tested in Alpinia blepharocalyx through a hand-pollination experiment. \u2022 Methods: Hand-pollinations were performed in two temporal morphs and consisted of two sequential pollination treatments, namely self-pollination in the morning and inter-morph pollination in the afternoon (treatment 1) or conversely inter-morph pollination in the morning and self-pollination in the afternoon (treatment 2), and two simultaneous self- and inter-morph cross-pollination treatments either in the morning (treatment 3) or in the afternoon (treatment 4). Seed paternity was then determined to assess relative success of self- versus cross-pollen using allozyme markers. \u2022 Key Results: In the sequential pollination treatments, whether the stigmas of recipients are receptive in the morning is crucial to the success of the pollen deposited. When the cataflexistylous (protandrous) morph served as pollen recipient, early-arriving pollen in the morning can sire only a very small proportion (<15%) of seeds because the stigmas were then unreceptive. However, when the anaflexistylous (protogynous) morph served as pollen recipient, early pollen did gain a large competitive advantage over the late pollen, particularly when cross-pollen arrived first. Simultaneous self- and inter-morph cross-pollination indicated that outcross-pollen is more competitive than self-pollen on receptive stigmas. \u2022 Conclusions: Differential maturing of male and female organs in Alpinia blepharocalyx is sufficient for selfing avoidance, obviating the need for style movements. Instead, the upward style curvature of the cataflexistylous morph in the morning and the anaflexistylous morph in the afternoon most likely represents a means of reducing interference with pollen export. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

Spontaneous ivory seed (ivs) mutants of Ipomoea purpurea displaying pale pigmented flowers and ivory seeds are caused by insertions of DNA transposons into the bHLH2 gene that encodes a bHLH transcriptional regulator. A partial reduction in the expression of all structural genes encoding enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis was observed in the young flower buds of these ivs mutants. The DFR-B and ANS transcripts were completely abolished in the ivs seed coats, whereas the early biosynthetic genes for flavonol biosynthesis remained active. The production and accumulation of both proanthocyanidin and phytomelanin pigments in the ivory seed coats were drastically reduced. Moreover, the unbranched trichomes in the ivory seeds were smaller in size and fewer in number than those in the wild-type dark-brown seeds, and the surface of the epidermis without trichomes in the dark-brown seeds looked rougher, due to the protruding tangential walls, than that in the ivory seeds. Although the I. purpurea bHLH2 gene is the most closely related to the petunia AN1 gene, whose mutation is known to confer white flowers and to be deficient in acidification of their vacuoles, the vacuolar alkalization in the epidermal flower limbs of I. purpurea ivs mutants appears to occur normally. These results are discussed with regard to the function of bHLH transcriptional regulators controlling flower and seed pigmentation as well as other epidermal traits. \u00a9 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Thus, studies of plant nuclear proteins would be facilitated by a convenient experimental system for identification of proteins that are actively imported into the cell nucleus and visualization of their nuclear accumulation in vivo. To this end, we developed a system of vectors that allows screening for cDNAs coding for nuclear proteins in a simple genetic assay in yeast cells, and verification of nuclear accumulation in planta following one-step transfer and autofluorescent tagging of the identified clones into a multiple cloning site-compatible and reading frame-compatible plant expression vector. In a recommended third experimental step, the plant expression cassette containing the identified clone can be transferred, also by a one-step cloning, into a binary multigene expression vector for transient or stable coexpression with any other proteins. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

These plants can establish root symbioses with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria and are able to grow in nitrogen-poor soils. Medicago truncatula varieties show diverse adaptive responses to environmental conditions, such as saline soils. We have compared the differential root growth of two genotypes of M. truncatula (108-R and Jemalong A17) in response to salt stress. Jemalong A17 is more tolerant to salt stress than 108-R, regarding both root and nodulation responses independently of the nitrogen status of the media. A dedicated macroarray containing 384 genes linked to stress responses was used to compare root gene expression during salt stress in these genotypes. Several genes potentially associated with the contrasting cellular responses of these plants to salt stress were identified as expressed in the more tolerant genotype even in the absence of stress. Among them, a homolog of the abiotic stress-related COLD-REGULATEDA1 gene and a TFIIIA-related transcription factor (TF), MtZpt2-1, known to regulate the former gene. Two MtZpt2 TFs (MtZpt2-1 and MtZpt2-2) were found in Jemalong A17 plants and showed increased expression in roots when compared to 108-R. Overexpression of these TFs in the sensitive genotype 108-R, but not in Jemalong A17, led to increased root growth under salt stress, suggesting a role for this pathway in the adaptive response to salt stress of these M. truncatula genotypes. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

We identified the rice AGO gene MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1) from the analysis of seed-sterile mutants. In the mel1 mutant, chromosome condensation was arrested at early meiotic stages and irregularly sized, multinucleated, and vacuolated pollen mother cells (PMCs) frequently appeared in developing anthers. In addition, histone H3 lysine-9 dimethylation of pericentromeres was rarely reduced and modification of the nucleolar-organizing region was altered in mel1 mutant PMCs. The mutation also affected female germ cell development. These results indicate that the germ cell-specific rice MEL1 gene regulates the cell division of premeiotic germ cells, the proper modification of meiotic chromosomes, and the faithful progression of meiosis, probably via small RNA-mediated gene silencing, but not the initiation and establishment of germ cells themselves. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

Mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC) affects free-running circadian rhythms. To investigate how TIC functions within the circadian system, we introduced markers for the evening and morning phases of the clock into tic and measured evident rhythms. The phases of evening clock genes in tic were all advanced under light/dark cycles without major expression level defects. With regard to morning-acting genes, we unexpectedly found that TIC has a closer relationship with LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) than with CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1, as tic has a specific LHY expression level defect. Epistasis analysis demonstrated that there were no clear rhythms in double mutants of tic and evening-acting clock genes, although double mutants of tic and morning-acting genes exhibited a similar free-running period as tic. We isolated TIC and found that its mRNA expression is continuously present over the diurnal cycle, and the encoded protein appears to be strictly localized to the nucleus.

In the unicellular ancestors, secretion of material through the endomembrane system was the major mechanism for interacting and shaping the external environment. In a multicellular organism, the external environment can be made of other cells, some of which may have vastly different developmental fates, or be part of different tissues or organs. In this context, a given cell must find ways to organize its secretory pathway at a level beyond that of the unicellular ancestor. Recently, sequence information from many green plants have become available, allowing an examination of the genomes for the machinery involved in the secretory pathway. In this work, the SNARE proteins of several green plants have been identified. While little increase in gene number was seen in the SNAREs of the early secretory system, many new SNARE genes and gene families have appeared in the multicellular green plants with respect to the unicellular plants, suggesting that this increase in the number of SNARE genes may have some relation to the rise of multicellularity in green plants. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

Seed from M2 to M5 generations (M = mutant) were used in the study. The M2 to M4 seeds were planted and evaluated in wooden boxes in the greenhouse and in the field. It was demonstrated that it was possible to examine mutant lines at the seedling stage in wooden boxes. Mature plants were screened in a rain-out shelter and physiological traits for drought stress were identified among the lines tested. Roots of mature plants were also assessed and the variation observed could be correlated with drought tolerance. Six mutant cowpea lines were included in a physiological screening experiment that was conducted on greenhouse plants. The data demonstrated that the mutant line 217 performed very well in terms of relative water content, free proline concentration and yield. The yield performance of the mutant lines 447, MA2 and 217 proved to be outstanding under well-watered conditions, whereas lines 447, 217 and 346 performed well under drought stress conditions."

Seeds from two sources (Fakahatchee Strand, Fla. Panther NWR) were sown on either modified oats medium (MOM) or standard oat medium (SOM) and inoculated with the fungus. Significant differences in germination were detected between the two seed sources. MOM had a significant effect on mean leaf length during incubation in vitro (F(1278) = 23.81, P > 0.000), but media had no significant effect on leaf number. After 48 days in vitro, all leaf-bearing seedlings were exposed to light and then transferred to greenhouse conditions ex vitro on sterile Sphagnum moss with or without half-strength Miracle-Gro (Scotts, Port Washington, N.Y.) commercial fertilizer. After 163 days ex vitro, seedlings on Sphagnum without Miracle-Gro displayed highest survivorship (>90%), whereas Miracle-Gro-exposed seedlings from standard oat agar experienced low (44%) survivorship. Healthy seedlings with a mycotrophic capability were obtained 1 year after sowing. A total of 43 seedlings were subsequently reintroduced into the Florida Panther NWR in Nov. 2005, 16 months after sowing. The symbiotic technique may, therefore, have practical merit for conservation of E. nocturnum and other epiphytic orchids threatened with extinction."

It is observed that this sort of heterocarpy is beneficial in environments with strong perturbations, in which a high percentage of the population dies. However, the frequency of such perturbations does not cause changes in the advantage of one strategy over the other.

It is widely recognized that determination of the intracellular localization of the encoded proteins may aid in identifying their functions. To facilitate these localization experiments, we have generated a series of fluorescent organelle markers based on well-established targeting sequences that can be used for co-localization studies. In particular, this organelle marker set contains indicators for the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the tonoplast, peroxisomes, mitochondria, plastids and the plasma membrane. All markers were generated with four different fluorescent proteins (FP) (green, cyan, yellow or red FPs) in two different binary plasmids for kanamycin or glufosinate selection, respectively, to allow for flexible combinations. The labeled organelles displayed characteristic morphologies consistent with previous descriptions that could be used for their positive identification. Determination of the intracellular distribution of three previously uncharacterized proteins demonstrated the usefulness of the markers in testing predicted subcellular localizations. This organelle marker set should be a valuable resource for the plant community for such co-localization studies. In addition, the Arabidopsis organelle marker lines can also be employed in plant cell biology teaching labs to demonstrate the distribution and dynamics of these organelles. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

To adequately investigate the combined effects of Mn nutrition and irradiance on photosystem 2 (PS2) activity, irradiance response curves for electron transport rate (ETR), nonphotochemical quenching (qN), photochemical quenching (qP), and real photochemical efficiency of PS2 (\u03a6PS2) were recorded under 10 different irradiances (66, 96, 136, 226, 336, 536, 811, 1 211, 1 911, and 3 111 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1, I66 to I3111, respectively) generated with the PAM-2000 fluorometer. Leaf chlorophyll content was significantly lower under Mn excess (Mn686) compared to Mn0; its highest values were recorded in the treatments Mn2-Mn98. However, ETR and \u03a6PS2 values were significantly lower under Mn0 compared to the other Mn treatments, when plants were exposed to irradiances \u226596 \u03bcmol m-2 s -1. Furthermore, Mn0 plants had significantly higher values of qN and lower values of qP at irradiances \u2264226 and \u2265336 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1, respectively, than those grown under Mn2-Mn686. Irrespective of Mn treatment, the values of \u03a6PS2 and qN decreased, while those of q P increased progressively by increasing irradiance from I 136 to I3111. Finally, Mn2-Mn98 plants were less sensitive to photoinhibition of photosynthesis (\u2265811 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1) than the Mn686 (\u2265536 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1) and Mn0 (\u2265336 \u03bcmol m -2 s-1) ones. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Experimental Botany, ASCR."

(Thymelaeaceae), at the canopy level in the lowland tropical rainforest at Pasoh, Peninsular Malaysia. The measurements were made from a canopy walkway system, 30 m from the ground for 3 d in March 2003. PN increased with increasing photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) before noon, though PN was not enhanced by the strong radiation hit in the afternoon. Plotting gs at saturating PAR (>0.5 mmol m-2 s-1) against the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) failed to reveal a significant correlation between VPD and gs, and gs became very low at VPD >2.5 kPa. The relationship between PN and g s was fitted on the same regression line irrespective of measuring day, indicating that this relationship was not influenced by either VPD or leaf temperature (TL). Therefore, in the liana E. malaccensis, an increase in VPD leads to partial stomatal closure and, subsequently, reductions in PN and the midday depression of PN of this plant. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Experimental Botany, ASCR."

            "text": "\u2022 Background and Aims: Myrmecochory is a conspicuous feature of several sclerophyll ecosystems around the world but it has received little attention in the semi-arid areas of South America. This study addresses the importance of seed dispersal by ants in a 2500-km2 area of the Caatinga ecosystem (north-east Brazil) and investigates ant-derived benefits to the plant through myrmecochory. \u2022 Methods: Seed manipulation and dispersal by ants was investigated during a 3-year period in the Xing\u00f3 region. Both plant and ant assemblages involved in seed dispersal were described and ant behaviour was characterized. True myrmecochorous seeds of seven Euphorbiaceae species (i.e. elaiosome-bearing seeds) were used in experiments designed to: (1) quantify the rates of seed cleaning/removal and the influence of both seed size and elaiosome presence on seed removal; (2) identify the fate of seeds dispersed by ants; and (3) document the benefits of seed dispersal by ants in terms of seed germination and seedling growth. \u2022 Key Results: Seed dispersal by ants involved one-quarter of the woody flora inhabiting the Xing\u00f3 region, but true myrmecochory was restricted to 12.8 % of the woody plant species. Myrmecochorous seeds manipulated by ants faced high levels of seed removal (38-84 %) and 83 % of removed seeds were discarded on ant nests. Moreover, seed removal positively correlated with the presence of elaiosome, and elaiosome removal increased germination success by at least 30 %. Finally, some Euphorbiaceae species presented both increased germination and seedling growth on ant-nest soils. \u2022 Conclusions: Myrmecochory is a relevant seed dispersal mode in the Caatinga ecosystem, and is particularly frequent among Euphorbiaceae trees and shrubs. The fact that seeds reach micro-sites suitable for establishment (ant nests) supports the directed dispersal hypothesis as a possible force favouring myrmecochory in this ecosystem. Ecosystems with a high frequency of myrmecochorous plants appear not to be restricted to regions of nutrient-impoverished soil or to fire-prone regions. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

            "text": "Current research indicates that plant populations should increase above the current Wisconsin recommendation of 74100 plants ha-1 for higher com (Zea mays L.) grain yields. However, stalls lodging is a major constraint to increasing plant populations. One option growers have is using Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) hybrids, which are known to lodge less. A new method for assessing stalk lodging risk is needed. The objectives of this stady were to (i) assess rind strength of corn hybrids with or without the Bt trait to increasing plant populations at natural levels of European Com Borer [ECB, Ostrinia nubilalis (H\u00fcbner)], and (ii) determine the potential of rind strength measurements for predicting stalli: lodging. In 2003 and 2004, rind penetrometer resistance (RPR) was used to measure rind strength for four Bt and five non-Bt hybrids with plant populations ranging from 64 220 to 123 500 plants ha -1 at 10 locations in Wisconsin. Stalk lodging increased from 6 to 18% as plant population increased, and only at one location, Arlington, did Bt hybrids lodge significantly less (20 vs. 42%) than non-Bt hybrids. The RPR of both Bt and non-Bt hybrids decreased from 3.9 to 3.7 load-kg plant-1 with increasing plant population. Plants with rind strength measurements < 3.9 load-kg plant-1 taken at physiological maturity showed more lodging. Thus, such measurements appear to be a good indicator of stalk lodging potential in a high plant population situation. This new method has potential to help growers prepare for grain harvest by identifying fields with plants having average RPR below a 3.9 load-kg plant-1 threshold, and adjusting harvest schedules of suspect fields earlier to avoid yield losses caused by stalk lodging. Further research using more hybrids across a range of environmental conditions and plant populations will be necessary to fully understand the importance of this tool and its potential importance in understanding and identifying high lodging potential environments. \u00a9 American Society of Agronomy."

The molecular basis of this variation is unknown. Ecotypic differences in the sequences and expression of four representative ZIP family transporter genes were investigated. Genome analysis indicated the presence of at least two closely related copies of the TcIRT1 gene in both Ganges (high Cd accumulating) and Prayon (low Cd accumulating) ecotypes, with different copies being expressed in each, and, furthermore, the two genes potentially encode different length transcripts. The predominant transcript in Prayon was truncated, missing sequence coding for the putative metal-binding site and the five C-terminal transmembrane helices. The two ecotypes were grown hydroponically \u00b1Fe and Cd, and mRNA abundance determined for four ZIP genes. The four ZIP genes studied (TcIRT1, TcIRT2, TcZNT1, and TcZNT5) were expressed in roots only. TcIRT1 expression (full-length in Ganges, TcIRT1-1G; truncated in Prayon, TcIRT1-2P) was enhanced by Fe deficiency or by exposure to Cd. TcIRT2 expression was induced by Fe deficiency, but was unaffected by Cd exposure. TcZNT5-G showed greater expression in Prayon compared with Ganges. The functions of TcIRT1 from Ganges and Prayon and the Arabidopsis homologue were analysed by heterologous expression in yeast. All three IRT1 genes were able to facilitate growth on low Fe concentrations. Cd sensitivity of yeast was conferred in the order AtIRT1>TcIRT1-1G>TcIRT1-2P (truncated). Cd uptake after 4 h was only detectable following complementation by AtIRT1. The results suggest that although TcIRT1-G may be involved in Cd hyperaccumulation in the Ganges ecotype of T. caerulescens, the transporter expressed in yeast does not have an enhanced ability to transport Cd compared with AtIRT1. Therefore, the unique Cd-accumulating ability of the T. caerulescens Ganges ecotype must be due to the levels of expression of the protein or to other factors such as interacting proteins. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s)."

This paper appraises the developing technologies and analytical methods for quantifying pigments non-destructively and repeatedly across a range of spatial scales using hyperspectral remote sensing. Progress in deriving predictive relationships between various characteristics and transforms of hyperspectral reflectance data are evaluated and the roles of leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are reviewed. Requirements are identified for more extensive intercomparisons of different approaches and for further work on the strategies for interpreting canopy scale data. The paper examines the prospects for extending research to the wider range of pigments in addition to chlorophyll, testing emerging methods of hyperspectral analysis and exploring the fusion of hyperspectral and LIDAR remote sensing. In spite of these opportunities for further development and the refinement of techniques, current evidence of an expanding range of applications in the ecophysiological, environmental, agricultural, and forestry sciences highlights the growing value of hyperspectral remote sensing of plant pigments. \u00a9 The Author [2006].

The objective of this work was to study the general and specific combining ability of several horticulturally important traits in crosses between pest-resistant parents and those with saturated flower colors. Ten crapemyrtle parents were tested in a factorial mating design including 25 of the 29 possible families. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences (P \u2264 0.05) for all traits for the general combining ability of parents. The cross between 'Arapaho' and 'WHIT IV displayed the best specific combining ability for a desirable combination of height, leaf-out time, bloom time, and flower color based on current breeding objectives. Overall, this study revealed the importance of both additive and nonadditive genetic variability in crapemyrtle, suggesting that an integrated breeding strategy to capture both additive and dominance variance would be appropriate for producing new, improved crapemyrtle clones for the four traits evaluated."

            "text": "The latter part of the 19th and the first several decades of the 20th century can be described as a \"golden age\" for plant exploration and collecting. During the initial years of this period, agricultural scientists from the United States and elsewhere devoted considerable resources to collecting potential new crops for farmers as well as superior plants or cultivars of the species that farmers were already growing. Over time, there was a shift toward collecting unadapted germplasm, or raw material that possessed traits that plant breeders and other scientists could use for cultivar improvement and other types of research. Although many institutions and individuals were involved in plant collecting during this period, the creation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Seed and Plant Introduction in 1898, resulted in the largest single program devoted to plant exploration. This office employed many individuals, including David Fairchild, P.H. Dorsett, Frank Meyer, Walter Swingle, and Wilson Popenoe. These and many other individuals collected-and introduced into the United States-seeds and plants of thousands of fruits, vegetables, nuts, ornamentals, cereals, forages, oilseeds, and other types of crops. Although the mission of most of the plant explorations during this period was to collect any plants that appeared interesting or potentially useful, others focused on collecting targeted species. Much of the material collected during this era is still maintained by the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS), and much more of it shows up in the pedigrees of cultivars grown by farmers and gardeners today. In addition to collecting plants for immediate and future use, scientists of this era, such as Nicolai I. Vavilov and Jack Harlan, contributed greatly to the understanding of the evolution of plants and plant genetic diversity, and the interdependence of plants and civilization."

It seeks reconciliation of the apparently conflicting published physiological and cytological evidence on recovery from desiccation in bryophytes. \u2022 Methods: Observations were made of water-stress responses and recovery using infrared gas analysis and modulated chlorophyll fluorescence, and of structural and ultrastructural changes by light and transmission electron microscopy. \u2022 Key Results: Net CO2 uptake fell to zero at approx. 40 % RWC, paralleling the fluorescence parameter \u03a6PSII at 200 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1 PPFD. On re-wetting the moss after 9-18 d desiccation, the initially negative net CO2 uptake became positive 10-30 min after re-wetting, restoring a net carbon balance after approx. 0.3-1 h. The parameter Fv/Fm reached approx. 80 % of its pre-desiccation value within approx. 10 min of re-wetting. In the presence of the protein-synthesis inhibitors chloramphenicol and cycloheximide, recovery of Fv/Fm (and CO2 exchange) proceeded normally in the dark, but declined rapidly in the light. Though initial recovery was rapid, both net CO2 uptake and Fv/Fm required approx. 24 h to recover completely to pre-desiccation values. The fixation protocols produced neither swelling of tissues nor plasmolysis. Thylakoids, grana and mitochondrial cristae remained intact throughout the drying-re-wetting cycle, but there were striking changes in the form of the organelles, especially the chloroplasts, which had prominent lobes and lamellar extensions in the normally hydrated state, but rounded off when desiccated, returning slowly to their normal state within approx. 24 h of re-wetting. Sub-cellular events during desiccation and re-wetting were generally similar to those seen in published data from the pteridophyte Selaginella lepidophylla. \u2022 Conclusions: Initial recovery of respiration and photosynthesis (as of protein synthesis) is very rapid, and independent of protein synthesis, suggesting physical reactivation of systems conserved intact through desiccation and rehydration, but full recovery takes approx. 24 h. This is consistent with the cytological evidence, which shows the thylakoids and cristae remaining intact through the whole course of dehydration and rehydration. Substantial and co-ordinated changes in other cell components, which must affect spatial relationships of organelles and metabolic systems, return to normal on a time span similar to full recovery of photosynthesis. Comparison of the present data with recently published results suggests a significant role for the cytoskeleton in desiccation responses. \u00a9 The Author 2006.

In callus subjected to direct selection only small clusters of cells survived on medium with 150 or 200 mM NaCl, whereas on 100 mM small cell portions appear necrotic. When cell lines were obtained by successive subcultures on media with increased concentrations of NaCl, salt-tolerant calli were more compact and developed a greenish colour free from necrotic areas. The response of calli lines grown on media with NaCl was compared to control line. The NaCl-tolerant calli showed a decrease in relative growth rate and water content, with higher reductions in the 150 mM tolerant callus. Lipid peroxidation was increased in 50 mM and 100 mM NaCl-tolerant calli, while in 150 mM tolerant callus remained similar to 100 mM values. There was a significant increase in ascorbic acid content in 100 mM and 150 mM NaCl-tolerant calli as compared to the 50 mM, that was two-fold the value found in the control. Also, the contents of soluble and insoluble proteins increased in salt-tolerant lines.

Three MT nucleation sites have been described: the nuclear surface, the cell cortex and cortical MT branch points. The Arabidopsis thaliana (At) genome contains putative orthologues encoding all the components of characterized mammalian nucleation complexes: \u03b3-tubulin and \u03b3-tubulin complex proteins GCP2 to GCP6. We have cloned the cDNA encoding AtGCP2, and show that \u03b3-tubulin, AtGCP2 and AtGCP3 are part of the same tandem affinity-purified complex and are present in a large membrane-associated complex. In addition, small soluble \u03b3-tubulin complexes of the size expected for a \u03b3-tubulin core complex are recruited to isolated nuclei. Using immunogold labelling, AtGCP3 is localized to both the nuclear envelope (NE) and the plasma membrane. To identify domains that could play a role in targeting complexes to these nucleation sites, truncated AtGCP2- and AtGCP3-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins were expressed in BY-2 cells. Several domains from AtGCP2 and AtGCP3 are capable of targeting fusions to the NE. We propose that regulated recruitment of soluble \u03b3-tubulin- containing complexes is responsible for nucleation at dispersed sites in plant cells and contributes to the formation and organization of the various MT arrays. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

Mutant id1 plants have a prolonged vegetative growth phase and fail to make normal flowers. The ID1 gene, which encodes a nuclear-localized zinc finger protein, is expressed exclusively in immature leaves, suggesting that ID1 regulates a leaf-derived floral inductive signal. It is shown by western analysis with anti-ID1-specific antibody that ID1 co-localizes with ID1 mRNA in developing, immature leaves and, similarly, is absent in mature, photosynthetically active leaf blades, as well as the shoot apical meristem. Immunolocalization with anti-ID1 antibody shows that ID1 protein is detected in the nuclei of all cell types in immature leaves. Examination of plants grown in different day/night cycles revealed that ID1 gene expression and protein levels are largely unaffected by variations in light and dark, and that mRNA and protein levels do not follow a circadian pattern. The absence of ID1 expression in greening leaf tips coincides with the sink-to-source transition of developing leaves. It was found that ID1 levels are down-regulated in mature albino leaves similarly as in normal green leaves, suggesting that ID1 activity is controlled developmentally and is not affected by the sink/source status of the leaf or the inability of a mature leaf to engage in photosynthesis. The finding that ID1 expression is developmentally regulated and is unperturbed by external stimuli such as photoperiod supports the supposition that ID1 acts through the autonomous floral inductive pathway in maize. \u00a9 The Author [2006].

Here, we report that SULTR1;1 and SULTR1;2 are two essential components of the sulfate uptake system in roots and are regulated at posttranscriptional levels together with the previously reported transcriptional control. Double knockout of SULTR1;1 and SULTR1;2 by T-DNA insertion gene disruption resulted in complete lack of sulfate uptake capacity and severely affected plant growth under low-sulfur conditions. Expression of epitope-tagged proteins SULTR1;1mycHis and SULTR1;2mycHis, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, rescued the uptake of sulfate and the growth of the sultr1;1 sultr1;2 double knockout mutant. The recovery of the double knockout phenotypes was attributable to the posttranscriptional accumulation of sulfate transporter proteins that derive from the epitope-tagged transgenic constructs. Both SULTR1;1mycHis and SUTLR1;2mycHis mRNAs were predominantly found in roots and slightly induced by long-term sulfur limitation. SULTR1;1mycHis and SULTR1;2mycHis proteins were found exclusively in roots, and significantly accumulated by sulfur limitation, correlating with the induction of sulfate uptake activities. In the time course of short-term sulfate starvation treatment, SULTR1;1mycHis and SULTR1;2mycHis proteins were significantly accumulated during the 8- to 72-h period, causing substantial induction of sulfate uptake activities, while their corresponding mRNAs were expressed constantly around the initial levels, except for the transient induction in the first 2 h. This study suggested the importance of root-specific and sulfur deficiency-inducible accumulation of SULTR1;1 and SULTR1;2 sulfate transporter proteins for the acquisition of sulfate from low-sulfur environment. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

The lesion mimic mutant vad1-1 (for vascular associated death), which exhibits the light-conditional appearance of propagative hypersensitive response-like lesions along the vascular system, is a good model for studying the role of ethylene in programmed cell death and defense. Here, we demonstrate that expression of genes associated with ethylene synthesis and signaling is enhanced in vad1-1 under lesion-promoting conditions and after plant-pathogen interaction. Analyses of the progeny from crosses between vad1-1 plants and either 35S::ERF1 transgenic plants or ein2-1, ein3-1, ein4-1, ctr1-1, or eto2-1 mutants revealed that the vad1-1 cell death and defense phenotypes are dependent on ethylene biosynthesis and signaling. In contrast, whereas vad1-1-dependent increased resistance was abolished by ein2, ein3, and ein4 mutations, positive regulation of ethylene biosynthesis (eto2-1) or ethylene responses (35S::ERF1) did not exacerbate this phenotype. In addition, VAD1 expression in response to a hypersensitive response-inducing bacterial pathogen is dependent on ethylene perception and signaling. These results, together with previous data, suggest that VAD1 could act as an integrative node in hormonal signaling, with ethylene acting in concert with salicylic acid as a positive regulator of cell death propagation. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

            "text": "Maintenance of genome integrity depends on histone chaperone-mediated chromatin reorganization. DNA replication-associated nucleosome deposition relies on chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1). Depletion of CAF-1 in human cells leads to cell death, whereas in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), where it is involved in heterochromatin compaction and homologous recombination, plants are viable. The mechanism that makes the lack of CAF-1 activity compatible with development is not known. Here, we show that the FASCIATA1 (FAS1) gene, which encodes the CAF-1 large subunit, is a target of E2F transcription factors. Mutational studies demonstrate that one of the two E2F binding sites in its promoter has an activator role, whereas the other has a repressor function. Loss of FAS1 results in reduced type A cyclin-dependent kinase activity, inhibits mitotic progression, and promotes a precocious and systemic switch to the endocycle program. Selective up-regulation of the expression of a subset of genes, including those involved in activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, also occurs upon FAS1 loss. This activation is not the result of a global change in chromatin structure, but depends on selective epigenetic changes in histone acetylation and methylation within a small region in their promoters. This suggests that correct chromatin assembly during the S-phase is required to prevent unscheduled changes in the epigenetic marks of target genes. Interestingly, activation of the endocycle switch as well as introduction of activating histone marks in the same set of G2 checkpoint genes are detected upon treatment of wild-type plants with DNA-damaging treatments. Our results are consistent with a model in which defects in chromatin assembly during the S-phase and DNA damage signaling share part of a pathway, which ultimately leads to mitotic arrest and triggers the endocycle program. Together, this might be a bypass mechanism that makes development compatible with cell division arrest induced by DNA damage stress. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

            "text": "The Arabidopsis thaliana MYB26/MALE STERILE35 (MS35) gene is critical for the development of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium and subsequent dehiscence. MYB26 is localized to the nucleus and regulates endothecial development and secondary thickening in a cell-specific manner in the anther. MYB26 expression is seen in anthers and also in the style and nectaries, although there is no effect on female fertility in the ms35 mutant. MYB26 expression in anthers occurs early during endothecial development, with maximal expression during pollen mitosis I and bicellular stages, indicating a regulatory role in specifying early endothecial cell development. Overexpression of MYB26 results in ectopic secondary thickening in both Arabidopsis and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants, predominantly within the epidermal tissues. MYB26 regulates a number of genes linked to secondary thickening, including IRREGULAR XYLEM1 (IRX1), IRX3, IRX8, and IRX12. Changes in expression were also detected in two NAC domain genes, NAC SECONDARY WALL-PROMOTING FACTOR1 (NST1) and NST2, which have been linked to secondary thickening in the anther endothecium. These data indicate that MYB26 regulates NST1 and NST2 expression and in turn controls the process of secondary thickening. Therefore, MYB26 appears to function in a regulatory role involved in determining endothecial cell development within the anther and acts upstream of the lignin biosynthesis pathway. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

With all enzymatic components being nuclear encoded, the control of the antioxidant capacity depends on chloroplast-to-nucleus redox signaling. Using an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reporter gene line expressing luciferase under control of the redox-sensitive 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin A (2CPA) promoter, six mutants with low 2CPA promoter activity were isolated, of which five mutants show limitations in redox-box regulation of the 2CPA promoter. In addition to 2CPA, the transcript levels for other chloroplast antioxidant enzymes were decreased, although a higher oxidation status of the ascorbate pool, a higher reduction state of the plastoquinone pool, and an increased oxidation status of the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin pool demonstrated photooxidative stress conditions. Greening of the mutants, chloroplast ultrastructure, steady-state photosynthesis, and the responses to the stress hormone abscisic acid were wild type like. In the rosette state, the mutants were more sensitive to low CO2 and to hydrogen peroxide. Comparison of gene expression patterns and stress sensitivity characterizes the mutants as redox unbalanced in the regulation of nuclear-encoded chloroplast antioxidant enzymes and differentiates redox signaling cascades. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

Five soil samples representing three different soil textures were infested with oospores of P. capsici to produce 101, 102, 103, 104, or 10 5 spores per 10 g of air-dried soil. Each 10-g sample of infested soil was suspended in 400 ml of water and then passed through 106-, 63-, and 38-\u03bcm metal sieves. The filtrate was then passed through a 20-\u03bcm mesh filter. Materials caught on the filter were washed with water into two 50-ml centrifuge tubes and spun for 4 min (900 x g). The pellet was suspended in 30 ml of 1.6 M sucrose solution and centrifuged for 45 s (190 x g). The supernatant was passed through the 20-\u03bcm mesh filter. The sucrose extraction process of oospores was repeated five times to maximize oospore extraction. Materials caught on the 20-\u03bcm mesh filter were washed with water into a 50-ml tube and spun for 4 min (900 x g). The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of water, and the number of oospores was determined with a haemocytometer. The relationship between number of oospores recovered from the soil and number of oospores incorporated into the soil was \u0176 = -0.95 + 1.31X - 0.03X2 (R2 = 0.98), in which \u0176 = log10 of number of oospores recovered from the soil and X = log10 of number of oospores incorporated into the soil. The oospores were germinated after treatment with 0.1% KMnO4 solution for 10 min to induce germination. On the basis of the detection of ribosomal DNA, a QPCR method for P. capsici oospores was developed. PCR inhibitors were eliminated by extracting oospores from the soil by sieving-centrifugation. DNA was extracted and quantified from P. capsici oospores with suspensions of 101, 101.5, 102, 102.5, 103, 103.5, 104, 10 4.5, and 105 oospores per ml of water. The relationship between the DNA quantities and number of P. capsici oospores was \u0176 = -3.57 - 0.54X + 0.30X2 (R2 = 0.93), in which \u0176 = log 10 (nanogram of P. capsici DNA) and X = log10 (number of oospores). The relationship between the quantity of DNA of P. capsici oospores recovered from the soil and the number of oospores incorporated into the soil was determined by \u0176 = -3.53 - 0.73X + 0.32X2 (R2 = 0.955, P < 0.05), in which \u0176 = log10 (DNA quantity of P. capsici oospores recovered from the soil) and X = log10 (number of P. capsici oospores incorporated into the soil). Utilizing the sieving-centrifugation and QPCR methods, oospores of P. capsici were quantified in soil samples collected from commercial fields. \u00a9 2008 The American Phytopathological Society."

Accordingly, plastids and mitochondria, in a standard genetic cross, are transmitted to the seed progeny by the maternal parent only. Our objective was to test whether paternal plastids are transmitted by pollen as an exception. The maternal parent in our cross was a nuclear male sterile (ms1-1/ms1-1), spectinomycin-sensitive Ler plant. It was fertilized with pollen of a male fertile RLD-Spc1 plant carrying a plastid-encoded spectinomycin resistance mutation. Seedlings with paternal plastids were selected by spectinomycin resistance encoded in the paternal plastid DNA. Our data, in general, support maternal inheritance of plastids in A. thaliana. However, we report that paternal plastids are transmitted to the seed progeny in Arabidopsis at a low (3.9 \u00d7 10-5) frequency. This observation extends previous reports in Antirrhinum majus, Epilobium hirsutum, Nicotiana tabacum, Petunia hybrida, and the cereal crop Setaria italica to a cruciferous species suggesting that low-frequency paternal leakage of plastids via pollen may be universal in plants previously thought to exhibit strict maternal plastid inheritance. The genetic tools employed here will facilitate testing the effect of Arabidopsis nuclear mutations on plastid inheritance and allow for the design of mutant screens to identify nuclear genes controlling plastid inheritance. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

            "text": "After several years in the juvenile phase, adult citrus trees show seasonal periodicity of flowering. A prolonged exposure to low temperature is one of the most important environmental cues for floral induction in citrus. In the present study, the expression of flowering-related genes during the annual cycle of flowering and inductive low-temperature treatment in Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.) trees is investigated. Simultaneously, floral induction, which occurs before the period of morphological flower development, was estimated as the number of flowers after the forcing of sprouting by defoliation at 25\u00b0C. The expression of citrus FLOWERING LOCUS T homologues, CiFT, showed a seasonal increase during the floral induction period and was also induced by an artificial low-temperature treatment (15\u00b0C) at which floral induction occurred. By contrast, the mRNA level of CiFT did not show any distinct changes following a warm-temperature treatment (25\u00b0C) for 2.5 months, during which time floral induction was completely suppressed. Changes in the expression of the citrus homologues of TERMINAL FLOWER 1, LEAFY, and APETALA1 did not show any correlation with floral induction in the field or under artificial low-temperature conditions. In juvenile seedlings of Satsuma mandarin, which does not flower even under inductive low-temperature conditions, the mRNA levels of CiFT were not affected by the low-temperature treatment, unlike adult tissues. These results suggest that low temperature promotes floral induction via the activation of CiFT transcription in adult Satsuma mandarin trees and that, in the juvenile plant, CiFT transcription does not respond to low temperature. \u00a9 The Author [2007].

To understand better NaCl stress responses in Arabidopsis roots, a comparative proteomic analysis of roots that had been exposed to 150 mM NaCl for either 6 h or 48 h was conducted. Changes in the abundance of protein species within roots were examined using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Among the >1000 protein spots reproducibly detected on each gel, the abundance of 112 protein spots decreased and 103 increased, at one or both time points, in response to NaCl treatment. Through liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, identity was assigned to 86 of the differentially abundant spots. The proteins identified included many previously characterized stress-responsive proteins and others related to processes including scavenging for reactive oxygen species; signal transduction; translation, cell wall biosynthesis, protein translation, processing and degradation; and metabolism of energy, amino acids, and hormones. At the resolution of individual genes and proteins, poor statistical correlation (6 h, r= -0.13; 48 h, r=0.11) of these protein expression data with previous microarray results was detected, supporting the concept that post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in stress-responsive gene expression, and highlighting the need for combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s)."

The structure of 1 was established using a combination of 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric techniques. Component 2 was identified by means of ESI-MS/MS analysis. Industrial relevance: Chlorophylls and their degradation products are natural pigments of interesting bioactivities. For industry, recovery of these pigments from waste materials of fruit and vegetable processings could be a promising by-product line. Here we present the isolation of a pure chlorophyll breakdown product which is in principle suited as a nutraceutical ingredient. Large-scale isolation procedures using countercurrent chromatography techniques for chlorophyll related pigments are currently under development. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Wollemia nobilis is a unique coniferous tree of the family Araucariaceae and is of very high scientific value as it is the sole living representative of an ancient genus, which until 1994 was known only from fossils. \u2022 Methods: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gas chromatography (GC) combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) were used for characterizing the morphology and the chemical structure of the epicuticular wax layer of W. nobilis needles. \u2022 Key Results: The main component of the leaf epicuticular wax of W. nobilis is nonacosan-10-ol. This secondary alcohol together with nonacosane diols is responsible for the tubular habit of the epicuticular wax crystals. Scanning electron micrographs revealed differences in the fine structure of adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces that could be explained by gas chromatographic studies after selective mechanical removal of the waxes. \u2022 Conclusions: SEM investigations established the tubular crystalline microstructure of the epicuticular wax of W. nobilis leaves. GC-MS and NMR experiments showed that nonacosan-10-ol is the major constituent of the epicuticular wax of W. nobilis leaves. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

Molecular studies have demonstrated that the S-RNase and SLF/SFB genes encoded by the single polymorphic S locus, which control the pollen and pistil functions of SI in three distantly related families, the Solanaceae, Scrophulariaceae and Rosaceae, are organized in a haplotype-specific manner. Previous work suggested that the haplotype structure of the two genes is probably maintained by recombination suppression at the S locus. To examine features associated with this suppression, we first mapped the S locus of Antirrhinum hispanicum, a member of the Scrophulariaceae, to a highly heterochromatic region close to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 8. Both leptotene chromosome and DNA fiber fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses showed an obvious haplotype specificity of the Antirrhinum S locus that is consistent with its haplotype structure. A chromosome inversion was also detected around this region between A. majus and A. hispanicum. These results revealed that DNA sequence polymorphism and a heterochromatic location are associated with the S locus. Possible roles of these features in maintenance of the haplotype specificity involved in both self and non-self recognition are discussed. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

            "text": "The role of aquatic macrophytes in stimulating biodiversity and maintaining clear waters is currently undisputed. The management of (eutrophic) shallow waters is therefore often directed at (re-)establishing macrophyte domination. In contrast, the role of water birds has long been considered of minor importance for the functioning of fresh water ecosystems. Indeed, in terms of biomass and production, water birds constitute only a minor part of these systems. However, water birds may graze heavily on water plants under certain circumstances, and the question arises whether herbivorous water birds have an important indirect effect on shallow fresh water systems. Mainly illustrated with the interaction between Bewick's Swans and Fennel Pondweed, we present data on the role that water plants may play in the life of water birds and how water birds may impact water plants' fitness in terms of survival, production, dispersal and competitive ability. It appears that water plants may be crucial for water birds during periods of high-energy requirements, such as migration. Despite the plants' costs associated with water bird grazing, the interaction between water birds and water plants varies in nature from an apparent predator-prey relationship to a mutually beneficial interaction depending on the context and the perspective. For the case of the Bewick's Swan-Fennel Pondweed interaction, regular bird grazing is sustainable and may actually favour the plant's dispersal. Thus, Bewick's Swans themselves may in fact play a crucial role in establishing and maintaining the Fennel Pondweed rich staging sites between the swans' wintering and breeding grounds, which are vital for the swans' successful migration. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

Expression of each gene in the rice gid1-1 mutant for GA receptors causes reversion of its severely dwarfed phenotype and GA insensitivity to a normal level, even though each loss-of-function mutant shows no clear phenotype in Arabidopsis (Nakajima et al., 2006). In this paper, we report the functional redundancy and specificity of each AtGID1 by analyzing the multiple mutants for loss of function. Seeds of the double knockout mutants atgid1a atgid1b, atgid1a atgid1c and atgid1b atgid1c germinated normally. The double knockout mutant atgid1a atgid1c showed a dwarf phenotype, while other double mutants were of normal height compared to the wild-type. The stamens of the double knockout mutant atgid1a atgid1b were significantly shorter than those of the wild-type, and this leads to low fertility. A severe disarrangement of the pattern on its seed surface was also observed. The triple knockout mutant atgid1a atgid1b atgid1c did not germinate voluntarily, and only started to grow when the seed coat was peeled off after soaking. Seedlings of the triple knockout mutants were severe dwarfs, only a few millimeters high after growing for 1 month. Moreover, the triple knockout seedlings completely lost their ability to respond to exogenously applied GA. These results show that all AtGID1s function as GA receptors in Arabidopsis, but have specific role(s) for growth and development. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

Here, we show that the pre-mRNAs of Arabidopsis genes that encode serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, a conserved family of splicing regulators in eukaryotes, are extensively alternatively spliced. Remarkably about 95 transcripts are produced from only 15 genes, thereby increasing the complexity of the SR gene family transcriptome by six-fold. The AS of some SR genes is controlled in a developmental and tissue-specific manner. Interestingly, among the various hormones and abiotic stresses tested, temperature stress (cold and heat) dramatically altered the AS of pre-mRNAs of several SR genes, whereas hormones altered the splicing of only three SR genes. These results indicate that abiotic stresses regulate the AS of the pre-mRNAs of SR genes to produce different isoforms of SR proteins that are likely to have altered function(s) in pre-mRNA splicing. Sequence analysis of splice variants revealed that predicted proteins from a majority of these variants either lack one or more modular domains or contain truncated domains. Because of the modular nature of the various domains in SR proteins, the proteins produced from splice variants are likely to have distinct functions. Together our results indicate that Arabidopsis SR genes generate surprisingly large transcriptome complexity, which is altered by stresses and hormones. \u00a9 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Although this disease resistance gene encodes a typical nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) disease resistance protein, its function is independent of the defense hormone salicylic acid and most known genes required for plant immune responses. We identified EDM2 (enhanced downy mildew 2) in a genetic screen for RPP7 suppressors. Mutations of EDM2 phenocopy RPP7 mutations, but do not affect other tested disease resistance genes. We isolated EDM2 by map-based cloning. The predicted EDM2 protein is structurally unrelated to previously identified components of the plant immune system, bears typical features of transcriptional regulators, including plant homeodomain (PHD)-finger-like domains, and defines a plant-specific protein family. In edm2 mutants both constitutive and HpHiks1-induced RPP7 transcript levels are reduced, suggesting that EDM2 is either a direct or an indirect regulator of RPP7 expression. Microarray analyses defined a set of defense-associated genes, the expression of which is suppressed during successful HpHiks1 colonization of either rpp7 or edm2 plants. This transcriptional phenotype is counteracted by an EDM2/RPP7-dependent mechanism. \u00a9 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

These floras represent four different plant communities and landscapes that followed each other in time. The oldest flora was rooted in sandy clay and initiated peat accumulation that lead to the formation of the lower coal seam. This seam is 230-cm thick and overlain by a 66-cm thick volcanic tuff that preserves a second different flora that grew on the peat at the time of the ash-fall. Standing stems and large plant parts are present. The upper part of the tuff is rooted by a single species of lycopsid (the third flora) again initiating peat accumulation. On top of this second seam of 120\u00a0cm thickness rests a roof-shale, deposited as mud in a shallow lake, the formation of which was responsible for the cessation of peat deposition. This fourth flora represents the plants growing around the lake on clastic substrate. Four different environments followed each other in this locality over a geologically short time span and each time conditions prevailed to preserve plant macrofossils. Three of these floras represent peat-forming plant communities of essentially the same time interval.

They interact with their target mRNA at a site of sequence complementarity and modulate their expression levels. Here, we provide evidence, based on transient assays and stable transgenic lines, that the 3\u2032 UTR of the Arabidopsis SBP box gene SPL3 contains a functional miRNA-responsive element (MRE) that is complementary to miR156 and miRNA157. Seedlings of transgenic lines constitutively over-expressing an SPL3 transgene either carrying an unaltered or a disrupted MRE accumulate considerable levels of SPL3 transcripts. However, while the unaltered MRE UTR does not allow the expression of detectable levels of SPL3 protein, the altered MRE does. Translational inhibition thus provides an important mechanism for miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional repression of SPL3. As a consequence of precocious translation of the constitutively expressed SPL3 transgene, due to the absence of a functional MRE, plants exhibit very early flowering in addition to frequent morphological changes. \u00a9 2007 Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

The superpromoter consists of a trimer of the octopine synthase transcriptional activating element affixed to the mannopine synthase2\u2032 (mas2\u2032) transcriptional activating element plus minimal promoter. We tested a superpromoter-\u03b2-glucuronidaseA fusion gene in stably transformed tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and maize (Zea mays) plants and in transiently transformed maize Black Mexican Sweet protoplasts. In both tobacco and maize, superpromoter activity was much greater in roots than in leaves. In tobacco, superpromoter activity was greater in mature leaves than in young leaves, whereas in maize activity differed little among the tested aerial portions of the plant. When compared with other commonly used promoters (cauliflower mosaic virus 35S, mas2\u2032, and maize ubiquitin), superpromoter activity was approximately equivalent to those of the other promoters in both maize Black Mexican Sweet suspension cells and in stably transformed maize plants. The addition of a maize ubiquitin intron downstream of the superpromoter did not enhance activity in stably transformed maize. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

            "text": "In all organisms, control of folate homeostasis is of vital importance to sustain the demand for one-carbon (C1) units that are essential in major metabolic pathways. In this study we induced folate deficiency in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cells by using two antifolate inhibitors. This treatment triggered a rapid and important decrease in the pool of folates with significant modification in the distribution of C1-substituted folate coenzymes, suggesting an adaptive response to favor a preferential shuttling of the flux of C1 units to the synthesis of nucleotides over the synthesis of methionine (Met). Metabolic profiling of folate-deficient cells indicated important perturbation of the activated methyl cycle because of the impairment of Met synthases that are deprived of their substrate 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate. Intriguingly, S-adenosyl-Met and Met pools declined during the initial period of folate starvation but were further restored to typical levels. Reestablishment of Met and S-adenosyl-Met homeostasis was concomitant with a previously unknown posttranslational modification that consists in the removal of 92 amino acids at the N terminus of cystathionine \u03b3-synthase (CGS), the first specific enzyme for Met synthesis. Rescue experiments and analysis of different stresses indicated that CGS processing is specifically associated with perturbation of the folates pool. Also, CGS processing involves chloroplastic serine-type proteases that are expressed in various plant species subjected to folate starvation. We suggest that a metabolic effector, to date unidentified, can modulate CGS activity in vivo through an interaction with the N-terminal domain of the enzyme and that removal of this domain can suppress this regulation. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

            "text": "The health benefits of cranberries have long been recognized. However, the mechanisms behind its function are poorly understood. We have investigated the iron-binding properties of quercetin, the major phenolic phytochemical present in cranberries, and other selected phenolic compounds (chrysin, 3-hydroxyflavone, 3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxy flavone, rutin, and flavone) in aqueous media using UV/vis, NMR and EPR spectroscopies and ESI-Mass spectrometry. Strong iron-binding properties have been confirmed for the compounds containing the \"iron-binding motifs\" identified in their structures. The apparent binding constants are estimated to be in the range of 106 M-1 to 1012 M-2 in phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. Surprisingly, quercetin binds Fe2+ even stronger than the well known Fe2+-chelator ferrozine at pH 7.2. This may be the first example of an oxygen-based ligand displaying stronger Fe 2+-binding affinity than a strong nitrogen-based Fe 2+-chelator. The strong Fe-binding properties of these phenolics argue that they may be effective in modulating cellular iron homeostasis under physiological conditions. Quercetin can completely suppress Fenton chemistry both at micromolar levels and in the presence of major cellular iron chelators like ATP or citrate. However, the radical scavenging activity of quercetin provides only partial protection against Fenton chemistry-mediated damage while Fe chelation by quercetin can completely inhibit Fenton chemistry, indicating that the chelation may be key to its antioxidant activity. These results demonstrate that quercetin and other phenolic compounds can effectively modulate iron biochemistry under physiologically relevant conditions, providing insight into the mechanism of action of bio-active phenolics. \u00a9  The Royal Society of Chemistry."

To investigate the underlying mechanism, we analyzed a genetic suppressor, scc7-D (suppressors of cry1cry2), which suppressed the long-hypocotyl phenotype of the cry1cry2 (cryptochrome1/ cryptochrome2) mutant in a light-dependent but wavelength-independent manner. scc7-D is a gain-of-expression allele of the GA2ox8 gene encoding a gibberellin (GA)-inactivating enzyme, GA 2-oxidase. Although scc7-D is hypersensitive to light, transgenic seedlings expressing GA2ox at a level higher than scc7-D showed a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype, confirming a general role of GA2ox and GA in the suppression of hypocotyl elongation. Prompted by this result, we investigated blue light regulation of mRNA expression of the GA metabolic and catabolic genes. We demonstrated that cryptochromes are required for the blue light regulation of GA2ox1, GA20ox1, and GA3ox1 expression in transient induction, continuous illumination, and photoperiodic conditions. The kinetics of cryptochrome induction of GA2ox1 expression and cryptochrome suppression of GA20ox1 or GA3ox1 expression correlate with the cryptochrome-dependent transient reduction of GA4 in etiolated wild-type seedlings exposed to blue light. Therefore we propose that in deetiolating seedlings, cryptochromes mediate blue light regulation of GA catabolic/metabolic genes, which affect GA levels and hypocotyl elongation. Surprisingly, no significant change in the GA4 content was detected in the whole shoot samples of the wild-type or cry1cry2 seedlings grown in the dark or continuous blue light, suggesting that cryptochromes may also regulate GA responsiveness and/or trigger cell- or tissue-specific changes of the level of bioactive GAs. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

            "text": "Because of greater interest in green roofs in the United States, it is critical to increase the number and geographic range of proven plant resources for long-term survival on rooftops. Successful plant taxa for extensive green roofs must establish themselves quickly, provide high groundcover density, and tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Furthermore, dead load weight restrictions on many buildings may limit the substrate depth that can be applied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of substrate depth on initial establishment and survival of 25 succulent plant taxa for green roof applications in the midwestern United States. Survival, initial growth, and rate of coverage were compared for plants grown in three substrate depths (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 cm) on 24 roof platforms. Plant coverage was determined from image analysis of weekly digital photographs. Results indicate deeper substrates promote greater survival and growth; however, in the shallowest depth of 2.5 cm, several species continued to persist. Of the 25 species initially planted, only 47% survived in the deepest substrate of 7.5 cm. Recommended species at the depths tested for climates similar to southern Michigan include Phedimus spurious Raf. 'Leningrad White', Sedum acre L., S. album L. 'Bella d'Inverno', S. middendorffianum L., S. reflexum L., S. sediforme J., and S. spurium Bieb. 'Summer Glory'. Subsidiary species that are present at specific substrate depths but may not exhibit an ability to cover large areas include S. dasyphyllum L. 'Burnatii', S. dasyphyllum L. 'Lilac Mound', S. diffusum W., S. hispanicum L., and S. kamtschaticum Fisch. The primary deterrent for these subsidiary species was little to no survival at 2.5 cm. Deeper substrates promoted greater survival and growth for nearly all species tested."

This work intended to understand the Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen strategies to prevent metal toxicity, by investigating the metal location in different plant organs and in the cell. A sequential extraction was performed on leaves, stems and roots of H. portulacoides in order to determine and compare the metal (Zn, Pb, Co, Cd, Ni and Cu) concentration in several fractions of the plant material (ethanolic, aqueous, proteic, pectic, polissacaridic, lenhinic and cellulosic). This study shows that all plant organs of H. portulacoides mostly retain metals in the cell wall (65% is the average for all studied metals stored in the root cell wall, 55% in the stems and 53% in the leaves), and the metal content in the intracellular compartment is much lower (21% in roots, 25% in stems and 32% in leaves). High levels of heavy metal in the sedimentary environment do not cause toxicity to H. portulacoides, because H. portulacoides immobilizes them in different cell compartments (cell wall + proteic fraction + intracellular) outside key metabolic sites. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal was to identify taxonomically the Mediterranean cucurbits at the time of the Roman Empire. \u2022 Findings: By ancient times, long-fruited forms of Cucumis melo (melon) and Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd) were selected, cultivated and used as vegetables around the Mediterranean and, in addition, bottle-shaped fruits of L. siceraria were employed as vessels. Citrullus lanatus (watermelons) and round-fruited forms of Cucumis melo (melons) were also consumed, but less commonly. A number of cucurbit species, including Bryonia alba, B. dioica, Citrullus colocynthis and Ecballium elaterium, were employed for medicinal purposes. No unequivocal evidence was found to suggest the presence of Cucumis sativus (cucumber) in the Mediterranean area during this era. The cucumis of Columella and Pliny was not cucumber, as commonly translated, but Cucumis melo subsp. melo Flexuosus Group (snake melon or vegetable melon). \u00a9 The Author 2007.

            "text": "For decades, palynologists working in tropical South America are using the genus Podocarpus as a climate indicator although without referring to any modern data concerning its distribution and limiting factors. With the aim to characterize the modern and past distribution of the southern conifer Podocarpus in Brazil and to obtain new information on the distribution of the Atlantic rainforest during the Quaternary, we examined herbarium data to locate the populations of three Brazilian endemic Podocarpus species: P. sellowii, P. lambertii, and P. brasiliensis, and extracted DNA from fresh leaves from 26 populations. Our conclusions are drawn in the light of the combination of these three disciplines: botany, palynology, and genetics. We find that the modern distribution of endemic Podocarpus populations shows that they are widely dispersed in eastern Brazil, from north to south and reveals that the expansion of Podocarpus recorded in single Amazonian pollen records may have come from either western or eastern populations. Genetic analysis enabled us to delimit regional expansion: between 5\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 S grouping northern and central populations of P. sellowii expanded c. 16,000 years ago; between 15\u00b0 and 23\u00b0 S populations of either P. lambertii or sellowii expanded at different times since at least the last glaciation; and between 23\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 S, P. lambertii appeared during the recent expansion of the Araucaria forest. The combination of botany, pollen, and molecular analysis proved to be a rapid tool for inferring distribution borders for sparse populations and their regional evolution within tropical ecosystems. Today the refugia of rainforest communities we identified are crucial hotspots to allow the Atlantic forest to survive under unfavourable climatic conditions and, as such, offer the only possible opportunity for this type of forest to expand in the event of a future climate change. \u00a9 2007 The Authors."

Microcosms were designed as sealed, flow-through systems that allowed the growth of plants. Experiments were conducted to evaluate mineralization of 14C-labeled pyrene in a sand amended with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degrading Mycobacterium isolate KMS, barley plants, or barley plants with roots colonized by isolate KMS. Mineralization was quantified by collecting the 14CO2 produced from 14C-labeled pyrene at intervals during the 10-d incubation period. Roots and foliar tissues were examined for 14C incorporation. Mass balances for microcosms were determined through combustion of sand samples and collection and quantification of 14CO2 evolved from radiolabeled pyrene. No pyrene mineralization was observed in the sterile control systems. Greater release of 14CO2 was observed in the system with barley colonized by KMS than in microcosms containing just the bacterium inoculum or sterile barley plants. These findings suggest that phytostimulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons mineralization could be applied in remediation schemes.

The test plants were mung bean (Phaseolus radiatus), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), wheat (Triticum aestivum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), kale (Brassica alboglabra), Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris), and sweet corn (Zea mays). The growth of all the plants was adversely affected by TBA and MTBE. The 5-d median effective concentration (EC50) for the plants exposed to MTBE and TBA were in the range of 680 to 1,000 mg MTBE/kg soil (dry wt) and 1,200 to 3,500 mg TBA/kg soil (dry wt), respectively. The relative order of the sensitivity rankings is almost the same for MTBE and TBA. Methyl tert-butyl ether is more toxic than TBA to most of the test species. Based on the EC50 values, MTBE is approximately 1.5 to 3 times more potent than TBA. The sum of the toxic unit (TU) at 50% inhibition of the mixture (EC50mix) was calculated from the dose (TU-based)-response relationships using the trimmed Spearman-Karber method. The combined effect of MTBE + TBA on the plant growth was less than additive because the EC50 mix values were greater than 1 TU. This phenomenon may be due to the competition of MTBE and TBA in terms of their intake by plants. The combined effects of MTBE and TBA should be taken into account to assess their risk in gasoline-contaminated sites. \u00a9 2007 SETAC."

However, since the early conception of that theory, the image of ecosystem stability has been elaborated for shallow lakes far beyond the simple original model. After discussing how spatial heterogeneity and fluctuation of environmental conditions may affect the stability of lakes, we review work demonstrating that the critical nutrient level for lakes to become turbid is higher for smaller lakes, and seems likely to be affected by climatic change too. We then show how the image of just two contrasting states has been elaborated. Different groups of primary producers may dominate shallow lakes, and such states dominated by a particular group may often represent alternative stable states. In tropical lakes, or small stagnant temperate waters, free-floating plants may represent an alternative stable state. Temperate shallow lakes may be dominated alternatively by charophytes, submerged angiosperms, green algae or cyanobacteria. The change of the lake communities along a gradient of eutrophication may therefore be seen as a continuum in which gradual species replacements are interrupted at critical points by more dramatic shifts to a contrasting alternative regime dominated by different species. The originally identified shift between a clear and a turbid state remains one of the more dramatic examples, but is surely not the only discontinuity that can be observed in the response of these ecosystems to environmental change. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

The energy of tyrosines (Tyrs) was not effectively transferred to tryptophans (Trps) in CP43 and CP47. The fluorescence emission spectrum of CP43 and CP47 by excitation at 280 nm should be a superposition of the Tyr and Trp fluorescence emission spectra. The aromatic amino acids in CP43 and CP47 could transfer their energy to chlorophyll (Chl) a molecules by the Dexter mechanism and the F\u00f6ster mechanism, and the energy transfer efficiency in CP47 was much higher than that in CP43. In CP47 the F\u00f6ster mechanism must be the dominant energy transfer mechanism between aromatic amino acids and Chl a molecules, whereas in CP43 the Dexter mechanism must be the dominant one. Hence solar ultraviolet radiation brings not only damages but also benefits to plants. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Experimental Botany, ASCR."

To investigate this paradox, the hypothesis that the C4 advantage over C3 photosynthesis is diminished by drought was tested, and the underlying stomatal and metabolic mechanisms of this response determined. The effects of drought and high evaporative demand on leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic electron sinks in C3 and C4 subspecies of the grass Alloteropsis semialata were examined. Plant responses to climatic variation and soil drought were investigated using a common garden experiment with well-watered and natural rainfall treatments, and underlying mechanisms analysed using controlled drying pot experiments. Photosynthetic rates were significantly higher in the C4 than the C3 subspecies in the garden experiment under well-watered conditions, but this advantage was completely lost during a rainless period when unwatered plants experienced severe drought. Controlled drying experiments showed that this loss was caused by a greater increase in metabolic, rather than stomatal, limitations in C 4 than in the C3 leaves. Decreases in CO2 assimilation resulted in lower electron transport rates and decreased photochemical efficiency under drought conditions, rather than increased electron transport to alternative sinks. These findings suggest that the high metabolic sensitivity of photosynthesis to severe drought seen previously in several C4 grass species may be an inherent characteristic of the C4 pathway. The mechanism may explain the paradox of why C 4 species decline in arid environments despite high water-use efficiency. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s)."

The range of manganese extended x-ray absorption fine structure data collected from PS II until now has been, however, limited by the presence of iron in PS II. Using a crystal spectrometer with high energy resolution to detect solely the manganese K\u03b1 fluorescence, we are able to extend the extended x-ray absorption fine structure range beyond the onset of the iron absorption edge. This results in improvement in resolution of the manganese-backscatterer distances in PS II from 0.14 to 0.09 \u00c5. The high resolution data obtained from oriented spinach PS II membranes in the S1 state show that there are three di-\u03bc-oxo-bridged manganese-manganese distances of \u223c2.7 and \u223c2.8 \u00c5 in a 2:1 ratio and that these three manganese-manganese vectors are aligned at an average orientation of \u223c60\u00b0 relative to the membrane normal. Furthermore, we are able to observe the separation of the Fourier peaks corresponding to the \u223c3.2 \u00c5 manganese-manganese and the \u223c3.4 \u00c5 manganese-calcium interactions in oriented PS II samples and determine their orientation relative to the membrane normal. The average of the manganese-calcium vectors at \u223c3.4 \u00c5 is aligned along the membrane normal, while the \u223c3.2 \u00c5 manganese-manganese vector is oriented near the membrane plane. A comparison of this structural information with the proposed Mn4Ca cluster models based on spectroscopic and diffraction data provides input for refining and selecting among these models."

The amino acid sequence (281 residues) deduced from the nucleotide sequence was 25 residues shorter than those of vertebrate enzymes. Nevertheless, the recombinant Physarum enzyme showed enzyme activity comparable to that of the human enzyme. The recombinant Physarum enzyme showed a pH optimum of around 6.0, and apparent Km values of 2\u03bcM and 14\u03bcM for NADH and cytochrome b5 respectively. The purified recombinant enzyme showed a typical FAD-derived absorption peak of cytochrome b5 reductase at around 460 nm, with a shoulder at 480 nm. These results suggest that the Physarum enzyme plays an important role in the organism."

In the present study, a basal angiosperm, Machilus, together with the eudicot Rhododendron were used to illustrate the evolutionary dynamics of gene divergence in CPsHSPs. \u2022 Methods: Degenerate primers were used to amplify CPsHSP-related sequences from 16 Rhododendron and eight Machilus species that occur in Taiwan. Manual DNA sequence alignment was carried out according to the deduced amino acid sequence alignment performed by CLUSTAL X. A neighbour-joining tree was generated in MEGA using conceptual translated amino acid sequences from consensus sequences of cloned CPsHSP genes from eight Machilus and 16 Rhododendron species as well as amino acid sequences of CPsHSPs from five monocots and seven other eudicots acquired from GenBank. CPsHSP amino acid sequences of Funaria hygrometrica were used as the outgroups. The aligned DNA and amino acid sequences were used to estimate several parameters of sequence divergence using the MEGA program. Separate Bayesian inference of DNA sequences of Rhododendron and Machilus species was analysed and the resulting gene trees were used for detection of putative positively selected amino acid sites by the Codeml program implemented in the PAML package. Mean hydrophobicity profile analysis was performed with representative amino acid sequences for both Rhododendron and Machilus species by the Bioedit program. The computer program SplitTester was used to examine whether CPsHSPs of Rhododendron lineages and duplicate copies of the Machilus CPsHSPs have evolved functional divergence based on the hydrophobicity distance matrix. \u2022 Key Results: Only one copy of the CPsHSP was found in Rhododendron. However, a higher evolutionary rate of amino acid substitutions in the Hymenanthes lineage of Rhododendron was inferred. Two positively selected amino acid sites may have resulted in higher hydrophobicity in the region of the \u03b1-crystallin domain (ACD) of the CPsHSP. By contrast, the basal angiosperm, Machilus, possessed duplicate copies of the CPsHSP, which also differed in their evolutionary rates of amino acid substitutions. However, no apparent relationship of ecological relevance toward the positively selected amino acid sites was found in Machilus. \u2022 Conclusions: Divergent evolution was found for both Rhododendron lineages and the paralogues of CPsHSP in Machilus that were directed to the shift in hydrophobicity in the ACD and/or methionine-rich region, which might have played important roles in molecular chaperone activity. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

Migration and population growth of the pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), and symptom development were compared among eight resistant families of Pinus thunbergii. In the 16-month-old seedlings inoculated with the pathogen on the lower stem, symptom development and nematode propagation were rapid except for one family, Namikata-(t)-73. In the case of 28-month-old seedlings that were inoculated on the shoot, the nematode population was kept low in the lower stems and roots of many specimens. Resistance level was obviously improved especially in the family Misaki-(t)-90 compared to that in the juvenile stage about 30 cm in height. The resistance by the host cells might lag behind the PWN migration in the short seedlings. The age (size) of the seedlings suitable for the selection of resistant trees and for the inoculation test should be reassessed because the level of the resistance changes as the seedlings grow."

We have developed three versions of the academy, one focused on biology and biophotonics, one on cancer and biophotonics, and a third on plants and biophotonics. A fourth emphasis on biomedical engineering and biophotonics is planned. We have conducted one of these academies for three years and have had very good student retention and science fair winners. As part of our program we also have a summer academy for training teachers. Challenges have arisen amongst the various levels of Academies, chief among them sustainability.

Seventy-eight nonredundant proteins were identified, of which 42 novel proteins had previously not been associated with plant peroxisomes. Seventeen novel proteins carried predicted peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS) type 1 or type 2; 11 proteins contained PTS-related peptides. Peroxisome targeting was supported for many novel proteins by in silico analyses and confirmed for 11 representative full-length fusion proteins by fluorescence microscopy. The targeting function of predicted and unpredicted signals was investigated and SSL>, SSI>, and ASL> were established as novel functional PTS1 peptides. In contrast with the generally accepted confinement of PTS2 peptides to the N-terminal domain, the bifunctional transthyretin-like protein was demonstrated to carry internally a functional PTS2. The novel enzymes include numerous enoyl-CoA hydratases, short-chain dehydrogenases, and several enzymes involved in NADP and glutathione metabolism. Seven proteins, including \u03b2-glucosidases and myrosinases, support the currently emerging evidence for an important role of leaf peroxisomes in defense against pathogens and herbivores. The data provide new insights into the biology of plant peroxisomes and improve the prediction accuracy of peroxisome-targeted proteins from genome sequences. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

The seeds were germinated on simple MS media, while MS media with auxine and cytokinin was used for callus induction and regeneration of shoots. In tobacco, callus was successfully induced from leaf explants using a high ratio of auxin: Cytokinin. The over all callus induction frequency in SPTG-172 was greater than K-399 indicating a difference in the genetic background of two cultivars. Both cultivars also showed best response to different hormonal concentrations. The resultant calli were stimulated to form shoots by increasing the cytokinin concentration and decreasing auxin content of culture media. There were clear differences between the two cultivars in their ability to produce regenerated plants. The maximum number of calli were regenerated in SPTG-172 whereas the mean number of shoots produced per callus at all concentrations was higher in K-399 indicating that's shoot regeneration is markedly affected by the genotype. The roots developed well on hormones free MS media in both cultivars irrespectively of the varietal difference. The well-rooted plants were then transferred to green house for acclimatization-to-the in vitro environment. \u00a9 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information."

Various in vitro assays were performed to achieve the aim and variation in scavenging potential of the six extracts, in addition to quantification of phenolic and flavonoid compounds was done by HPLC. Among the six extracts, methanolic extract have showed highest Total phenolic content (TPC), metal chelation activity and free radical scavenging potential against DPPH, ABTS and superoxide anions as compared to other extracts. The highest scavenging potential against nitric oxide and hypochlorus acid was shown by acetone extract. The variation in anti-oxidant activity of the extracts may be due to the phyto-constituents present in different solvents. A significant correlation (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.864) was established between antioxidant and TPC of H. coronarium from principle component analysis. Thus the present study provides strong evidence that rhizome extract of H. coronarium is a potential source of bioactive compounds and can be used as a remedy for diseases caused due to oxidative stress. Reported results could be helpful to develop novel drugs for the management of oxidative stress and associated diseases. \u00a9 2017, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India)."

Greenhouse tests can most likely predict how different Douglas fir provenances will perform in the field. Abstract: The need for species that will grow well through ongoing climate change has increased the interest in Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] in Sweden. One of the most common problems seen in plantations of Douglas fir seedlings is damage caused by late spring frost, known to be highly correlated with the timing of bud burst. The objective of this study was to investigate spring-related bud development under Nordic conditions of seven Douglas fir provenances and to compare data with a local provenance of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Results from a field trial and a greenhouse-based study were compared. The interior Douglas fir provenances exhibited an earlier bud burst than coastal provenances, both in the greenhouse and in the field trial. When comparing differences within the groups of interior and coastal Douglas fir provenances, no differences could be found. The local Norway spruce, only grown in the greenhouse, showed an intermediate bud development profile similar to the interior Douglas fir provenance Three Valley. We therefore suggest that Three Valley could be planted at the same locations as the investigated local provenance of Norway spruce in mid-Sweden. To avoid spring frost damage the Douglas fir seedlings need to be frozen stored and planted late in spring. Planting under shelterwood can also help protect the seedlings from spring frost damages. As similar results for bud development patterns of Douglas fir and Norway spruce provenances were obtained from the greenhouse and field trials, greenhouse tests could facilitate selection of provenances. \u00a9 2017, The Author(s)."

Cell glycolysis increases the production of intracellular lactate catalyzed by the lactate dehydrogenases, both LDH-A and LDH-B. An increase in intracellular lactate can affect extracellular pH balance through monocarboxylate transporters, particularly MCT1 and MCT4. This study aimed to analyze the effects of extracellular alkalinization on the lactate metabolism of human breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). In this study, human primary BCSCs (CD24-/CD44+ cells) were treated with 100 mM sodium bicarbonate for 0.5, 24, and 48 h in DMEM F12/HEPES. After incubation, extracellular pH was measured and cells were harvested to extract the total RNA and protein. The expression of LDH-A, LDH-B, MCT1, and MCT4 mRNA genes were analyzed using qRT-PCR method. Our study shows that administration of sodium bicarbonate in the BCSC culture medium could increase extracellular pH. To balance the increase of extracellular pH, BCSCs regulated the expression of LDH-A, LDH-B, MCT1, and MCT4 genes. As the extracellular pH increases, the expression of LDH-A that converts pyruvate to lactate increased along with the increase of MCT 4 and MCT 1 expression, which act as lactate transporters. As the incubation time increases, the pH decreases, leading to the suppression of LDH-A and increase of LDH-B expression that converts lactate into pyruvate. Therefore, we suggest that the extracellular alkalinization by sodium bicarbonate in BCSCs affected the genes that regulate lactate metabolism. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

Earlier, mineral N was considered the only form available to plants. Recent studies have questioned this dogma and shown that plants may access organic N sources such as amino acids. The actual mechanism enabling plants to access amino acid N is still unknown. However, a recent study suggested the Lysine Histidine Transporter 1 (LHT1) to be involved in root amino acid uptake. In this study, we isolated mutants defective in root amino acid uptake by screening Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds from ethyl methanesulfonate-treated plants and seeds from amino acid transporter T-DNA knockout mutants for resistance against the toxic D-enantiomer of alanine (Ala). Both ethyl methanesulfonate and T-DNA knockout plants identified as D-Ala resistant were found to be mutated in the LHT1 gene. LHT1 mutants displayed impaired capacity for uptake of a range of amino acids from solutions, displayed impaired growth when N was supplied in organic forms, and acquired substantially lower amounts of amino acids than wild-type plants from solid growth media. LHT1 mutants grown on mineral N did not display a phenotype until at the stage of flowering, when premature senescence of old leaf pairs occurred, suggesting that LHT1 may fulfill an important function at this developmental stage. Based on the broad and unbiased screening of mutants resistant to D-Ala, we suggest that LHT1 is an important mediator of root uptake of amino acids. This provides a molecular background for plant acquisition of organic N from the soil. \u00a9 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists."

            "text": "The typical isohydric plant response to low relative humidity involves stomatal closure, followed by long-term responses like adjustment of shoot-to-root ratios. Little information is available on the early responses of the root system to exposure of shoots to low humidity, nor is it clear to what extent responses of Arabidopsis thaliana conform to the isohydric model. In this study, A. thaliana plants grown hydroponically at high humidity were exposed to two constant relative humidities, 17% and 77%, while the root system remained in aerated nutrient solution. Leaf conductance (gs), transpiration, water potential (\u03a8l), osmotic potential, and whole plant hydraulic conductance (K) were determined for the following time intervals: 0-10, 10-20, and 20-40 min, and 0-5, 5-10, and 24-29 h. At low relative humidity, no change in gs was detected. \u03a8l decreased by 0.28 MPa during the first 5 h and then remained stable. During the first hour, leaf-specific K averaged 1.6\u00d710-5 kg MPa-1 m-2 s-1 at high humidity. At low humidity it increased >3-fold to 5.8\u00d710-5 kg MPa-1 m-2 s-1. Similar significant differences in K were observed during all time periods. Low concentration mercury amendments in the hydroponic solution (5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM HgCl2) had no discernible influence, but pre-exposure to 50 \u03bcM HgCl2 reduced K differences between humidity treatments. As HgCl2 is known to be a potent inhibitor of aquaporin function, this suggests that aquaporins may have played a role in the fast hydraulic response of plants transferred to low humidity. The rapid hydraulic response and the influence of mercury raise the possibility that an alternative response to atmospheric dryness is increased K modulated by aquaporins. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s)."

            "text": "We tested the hypothesis that invasive (IN) species could capture resources more rapidly and efficiently than noninvasive (NIN) species. Two IN alien species, Ageratina adenophora and Chromolaena odorata, and one NIN alien species, Gynura sp. were compared at five irradiances. Photon-saturated photosynthetic rate (Pmax), leaf mass (LMA) and nitrogen content (NA) per unit area, and photosynthetic nitrogen utilization efficiency (PNUE) increased significantly with irradiance. LMA, NA, and PNUE all contributed to the increased Pmax, indicating that both morphological and physiological acclimation were important for the three alien species. Under stronger irradiance, PNUE was improved through changes in N allocation. With the increase of irradiance, the amount of N converted into carboxylation and bioenergetics increased, whereas that allocated to light-harvesting components decreased. The three alien species could adequately acclimate to high irradiance by increasing the ability to utilize and dissipate photon energy and decreasing the efficiency of photon capture. The two IN species survived at 4.5 % irradiance while the NIN species Gynura died, representing their different invasiveness. Ageratina generally exhibited higher respiration rate (RD) and NA. However, distinctly higher Pmax, PNUE, Pmax/RD, or Pmax/LMA were not detected in the two invasive species, nor was lower LMA. Hence the abilities to capture and utilize resources were not always associated with invasiveness of the alien species. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Experimental Botany, ASCR."
