            "text": "Rationale: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has emerged as a frequent coinfection in severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19), similarly to influenza, yet the clinical invasiveness is more debated. Objectives: We investigated the invasive nature of pulmonary aspergillosis in histology specimens of influenza and COVID-19 ICU fatalities in a tertiary care center. Methods: In this monocentric, descriptive, retrospective case series, we included adult ICU patients with PCR-proven influenza/COVID-19 respiratory failure who underwent postmortem examination and/or tracheobronchial biopsy during ICU admission from September 2009 until June 2021. Diagnosis of probable/proven viral-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (VAPA) was made based on the Intensive Care Medicine influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis and the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) COVID-19\u2013associated pulmonary aspergillosis consensus criteria. All respiratory tissues were independently reviewed by two experienced pathologists. Measurements and Main Results: In the 44 patients of the autopsy-verified cohort, 6 proven influenza-associated and 6 proven COVID-19\u2013associated pulmonary aspergillosis diagnoses were identified. Fungal disease was identified as a missed diagnosis upon autopsy in 8% of proven cases (n = 1/12), yet it was most frequently found as confirmation of a probable antemortem diagnosis (n = 11/21, 52%) despite receiving antifungal treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan testing showed the highest sensitivity for VAPA diagnosis. Among both viral entities, an impeded fungal growth was the predominant histologic pattern of pulmonary aspergillosis. Fungal tracheobronchitis was histologically indistinguishable in influenza (n = 3) and COVID-19 (n = 3) cases, yet macroscopically more extensive at bronchoscopy in influenza setting. Conclusions: A proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis diagnosis was found regularly and with a similar histological pattern in influenza and in COVID-19 ICU case fatalities. Our findings highlight an important need for VAPA awareness, with an emphasis on mycological bronchoscopic work-up. \u00a9 2023 by the American Thoracic Society."

This study entails a 5-year retrospective analysis, using a cross-sectional study design to examine microbiology laboratory data of individuals clinically diagnosed with UTIs at Bugando Medical Centre to gain insights into the prevalence and factors linked to candiduria. METHODOLOGY: Data extracted were meticulously cleaned and coded in an MS Excel sheet, subsequently transferred to STATA V.15 for analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with candiduria. A probability value below 0.05 at a 95% CI was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Urine samples for culture and sensitivity comprised 33.4% (20755) of the total biological samples (62335). The median age of the patients stood at 19 years. A slight majority were female, accounting for 52.8% (10051), and two-thirds sought treatment at outpatient departments (67.5%, 12843). Among patients with significant pathogenic growth, the prevalence of candiduria was 4.6% (221 out of 4772). Notably, inpatients exhibited a higher incidence of candiduria compared with outpatients, with rates of 9.4% (1882) versus 1.6% (2890), p value of 0.000. Non-albicans Candida spp. (NAC) remained the most prevalent pathogen. Factors significantly associated with candiduria included being female (OR=1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3) and hospital admission (OR=6.6, 95%\u2009CI 4.7 to 9.2). In conclusion, candiduria affect 5 out of every 100 UTI-diagnosed patients, predominantly among females and those admitted to the hospital. Clinicians at tertiary hospitals should consider urinary candidiasis as a potential diagnosis for patients at risk who present with UTI-like symptoms. \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Written in the \u2018universal\u2019 scientific language of Latin, the Sylloge served as an early database of fungal knowledge and symbolized a broader unification of mycological inquiry in a moment of expanded scientific correspondence. The article situates this proto-database in broader histories of big data in biology and shows how the Sylloge formed a globalizing foundation for the twentieth century\u2019s major collecting and taxonomic advances in mycology. \u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.

In this review, I highlight five important advances in the neuroimmunology field over the last decade and discuss how we should capitalise on these discoveries to better understand the pathogenesis of fungal CNS infections.

This clinical ailment has a prevalence of between 30 and 60% and is more common in India\u2019s hot, muggy, tropical climate. Examining the prevalence of superficial mycoses (SM), their clinical symptoms, and the fungal species that were identified as the disease-causing agents were the main objectives of the current study. This study comprised 250 clinically confirmed patients with SM who visited our dermatology department over the course of a year. Skin scrapings, nail clippings, and hair samples were gathered, mounted, and cultured using KOH. Macroscopic examination of culture, tease mount, and phenotypic tests were used to identify the species. The age group of 11\u201320 years (29%) had the highest prevalence of SM out of the 250 clinically verified cases of the condition that were included in our study, followed by 21\u201330 years (20%) and 31\u201340 years (18%). Candida albicans, dermatophytes, and non-dermatophytic moulds were the three most prevalent fungal isolates. The most typical dermatophyte isolate was T. rubrum, which was primarily found in Tinea corporis (TCo), Tinea cruris (TCr), and Tinea faciei (TFa). T. mentagrophytes was the second most frequent isolate. According to our investigation, it was determined that non-dermatophytic moulds constitute a significant contributor to the development of SM in addition to dermatophytes. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Spores undergo a process of active swelling and cell wall remodelling before a germ tube is formed and filamentous growth ensues. Highly elongated germ tubes are known to be difficult to phagocytose and pose particular challenges for immune phagocytes. However, the significance of the earliest stages of spore germination during immune cell interactions has not been investigated and yet this is likely to be important for defence against sporogenous fungal pathogens. We show here that macrophages restrict the early phases of the spore germination process of Aspergillus fumigatus and Mucor circinelloides including the initial phase of spore swelling, spore germination and early polarised growth. Macrophages are therefore adept at retarding germination as well as subsequent vegetative growth which is likely to be critical for immune surveillance and protection against sporulating fungi. \u00a9 2023"

A multi-omics study of Pseudolycoriella hygida comb. nov. (Diptera: Sciaroidea: Sciaridae) aimed to characterize carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) for litter degradation in this species. Manual curation of 17,881 predicted proteins in the Psl. hygida genome identified 137 secreted CAZymes, of which 33 are present in the saliva proteome, and broadly confirmed by saliva CAZyme catalytic profiling against plant cell wall polysaccharides and pNP-glycosyl substrates. Comparisons with two other sciarid species and the outgroup Lucilia cuprina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) identified 42 CAZyme families defining a sciarid CAZyme profile. The litter-degrading potential of sciarids corroborates their significant role as decomposers, yields insights to the evolution of insect feeding habits, and highlights the importance of insects as a source of biotechnologically relevant enzymes. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

The detection of the Aspergillus-derived carbohydrate galactomannan in patient serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is the major biomarker used to detect A. fumigatus infection in clinical medicine. Despite the clinical relevance of this carbohydrate, we lack a fundamental understanding of how galactomannan is recognized by the immune system and its consequences. Galactomannan is composed of a linear mannan backbone with galactofuranose sidechains and is found both attached to the cell surface of Aspergillus and as a soluble carbohydrate in the extracellular milieu. In this study, we utilized fungal-like particles composed of highly purified Aspergillus galactomannan to identify a C-type lectin host receptor for this fungal carbohydrate. We identified a novel and specific interaction between Aspergillus galactomannan and the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-2. We demonstrate that galactomannan bound to Dectin-2 and induced Dectin-2-dependent signaling, including activation of spleen tyrosine kinase, gene transcription, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) production. Deficiency of Dectin-2 increased immune cell recruitment to the lungs but was dispensable for survival in a mouse model of pulmonary aspergillosis. Our results identify a novel interaction between galactomannan and Dectin-2 and demonstrate that Dectin-2 is a receptor for galactomannan, which leads to a proinflammatory immune response in the lung.  \u00a9 2023 Reedy et al."

            "text": "Background. The leaves of Serjania erecta Radlk (Sapindaceae) are renowned in ethnobotany for their medicinal properties and are significant as a medicinal resource for traditional Brazilian communities. As necrotic spots are common on these leaves, indicating interaction with phytopathogenic fungi, it was hypothesized that biotrophic fungal species colonize the leaf tissues of S. erecta. Methods. To test this hypothesis, we employed standard techniques in plant anatomy, which enabled us to investigate the interaction of fungal structures with plant tissues and describe the morphoanatomical and histochemical characteristics of the epidermis and limbus of S. erecta. Results. The anatomical analysis showed the existence of leaf teeth on the leaf tips. Additionally, hyphae, conidiospores, and spores of Bipolaris/Curvularia species were detected on the adaxial epidermis. Moreover, melanized microsclerotia were found in glandular areas of the leaf teeth and the phloem, providing evidence of biotrophic behavior. The hypothesis that biotrophic phytopathogenic fungi interact with S. erecta leaf tissues was confirmed, despite the presence of many bioactive compounds (such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and essential oils), as evidenced by histochemical analyses. The presence of tector, glandular, and scabiform trichomes on the leaf teeth and epidermis was also revealed. This study presents, for the first time, the synthesis of essential oils and alkaloids in the leaves of S. erecta. Additionally, it investigates previously unexplained aspects of the anatomy and histochemistry of the species, as well as its interaction with resident microorganisms. Therefore, it is recommended that future research focus on extracting and characterizing the oils and alkaloids of S. erecta, as well as exploring other aspects related to its microbiome and its relationship.

            "text": "Background: Early identification of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is particularly challenging in low- middle-income countries where diagnostic capabilities are limited, and risk factors for CAPA have not been identified. It is also essential to recognise CAPA patients who are likely to have a poorer outcome to decide on aggressive management approaches. Therefore, this study aimed to identify risk factors and outcomes for CAPA among admitted moderate to critical COVID-19 patients at our centre in Pakistan. Methods: An unmatched case\u2013control study with ratio of 1:2 was conducted on hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 from March 2020\u2013July 2021. Cases were defined according to European Confederation of Medical Mycology and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology consensus criteria. Controls were defined as patients hospitalised with moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 without CAPA. Results: A total of 100 CAPA cases (27 probable CAPA; 73 possible CAPA) were compared with 237 controls. Critical disease at presentation (aOR 5.04; 95% CI 2.18\u201311.63), age\u00a0\u2265 60 years (aOR 2.00; 95% CI 1.20\u20133.35) and underlying co-morbid of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (aOR 3.78; 95% CI 1.57\u20139.08) were identified as risk factors for CAPA. Patients with CAPA had a significantly greater proportion of complications and longer length of hospital stay (p-value <.001). Mortality was higher in patients with CAPA (48%) as compared to those without CAPA (13.5%) [OR\u00a0=\u00a06.36(95% CI 3.6\u201311)]. Conclusions: CAPA was significantly associated with advanced age, CKD and critical illness at presentation, along with a greater frequency of complications and higher mortality. \u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

Detection of galactomannan antigen is an important diagnostic step in diagnosing IPA. Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) is the most frequently used method, and lateral flow assay (LFA) is increasingly used with high sensitivity and specificity for rapid diagnosis. The present study aimed to compare the sensitivity of LFA and ELISA in the diagnosis of CAPA in COVID-19 patients followed in our hospital's ICU for pandemic (ICU-P). Methods: This study included patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and were followed up in ICU-P between August 2021 and February 2022 with acute respiratory failure. The diagnosis of CAPA was based on the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology 2020 (ECMM/ ISHAM) guideline. Galactomannan levels were determined using LFA and ELISA in serum samples taken simultaneously from the patients. Results: Out of the 174 patients followed in the ICU-P, 56 did not meet any criteria for CAPA and were excluded from the analysis. The rate of patients diagnosed with proven CAPA was 5.7% (10 patients). A statistically significant result was obtained with LFA for the cut-off value of 0.5 ODI in the diagnosis of CAPA (p < 0.001). The same significant statistical relationship was found for the cut-off value of 1.0 ODI for the ELISA (p < 0.01). The sensitivity of LFA was 80% (95% CI: 0.55\u20131.05, p < 0.05), specificity 94% (95% CI: 0.89\u20130.98, p < 0.05); PPV 53% (95% CI: 0.28\u20130.79, p > 0.05) and NPV was 98% (95% CI: 0.95\u20131.01, p < 0.05). The risk of death was 1.66 (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.02\u20132.86, p < 0.05) times higher in patients with an LFA result of \u2265 0.5 ODI than those with < 0.5 (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It is reckoned that LFA can be used in future clinical practice, particularly given its effectiveness in patients with hematological malignancies and accuracy in diagnosing CAPA. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

This diversity is influenced by numerous geobiological variables, which impact soil fungal distribution worldwide. The taxonomy of soil-associated fungi has been investigated over the years using various approaches. To recover below-ground fungal species, researchers currently use culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches such as high-throughput techniques. As a result, a significant amount of taxonomic information is being generated and scattered throughout many publications. Most recent publications and databases of soil Ascomycota are derived from high-throughput techniques mainly focused on higher taxonomic ranks; however, information of the genera and species identified from soils are not conglomerated into a single database. Therefore, the Soil Fungi website aims to create an online platform to compile the soil-associated fungal species with comprehensive taxonomic descriptions and continuously update them following the most recent classifications. The scattered information will be obtained from publications and conglomerated on the website where users have quick and user-friendly access. This paper introduces the https://soilfun.org/ website with its objectives and functions and provides a guideline for accessing and retrieving information. The website will serve as a central database of soil-associated fungal species, including their taxonomic descriptions and other relevant information. Users will be able to access and retrieve information from the website easily. The Soil Fungi website will be an essential tool for researchers, students, and other interested parties in soil mycology. \u00a9 The Author(s)."

Little is known of how foragers themselves define and ensure sustainable foraging. Here, we collaboratively assessed the activities and motivations of the forager community in Norway in order to achieve a combined social and ecological assessment of foraging sustainability. Current foraging of wild food plants in Norway contributes to an increased appreciation of nature rather than generating negative environmental impact and is hence an opportunity for sustainable development. Summary: Wild food plants are well recognized as local sources of nutrition that can contribute to food security, but foraging is sometimes viewed as a threat to biological conservation. Here, we characterize and assess sustainable foraging in Norway through transdisciplinary research co-constructed with the Norwegian Association for Mycology and Foraging. We conducted 19 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders and produced an online questionnaire returned by 219 recreational and commercial foragers to enquire about what species are harvested, by whom and how, where do foragers learn and what are their perspectives on the sustainability of foraging. Foraging fosters a strong connection with the natural environment. Foragers decide when and how much can be harvested considering location, plant and plant part being harvested. They pay attention to native plants' conservation status and local abundance and plant individual's survival after foraging and aim to not spread invasive species. We define sustainable foraging as the knowledge and practices that enable enriching forager\u2013biodiversity relationships over time. Such a definition can support collaborative sustainability efforts between the academic community and civil society. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

            "text": "As increasing evidence emerges that interstrain genetic diversity among Candida albicans clinical isolates underpins phenotypic variation compared to the reference isolate SC5314, new genetic tools are required to interrogate gene function across strain backgrounds. Here, the SAT1-flipper plasmid was reengineered to contain a C. albicans codon optimized hygromycin B resistance gene (CaHygB). Cassettes were PCR-amplified from both SAT1-flipper and CaHygB-flipper plasmids using primers with homologous sequences flanking target genes of interest to serve as repair templates. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing proprietary CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), universal transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), and Cas9 protein were assembled in vitro and transformed, along with both repair templates, by electroporation into C. albicans. Homozygous deletion of the ADE2 gene results in red-pigmented colonies and this gene was used to validate our approach. Both in SC5314 and a variety of clinical isolates (529L, JS15, SJCA1, TW1), homozygous gene targeting was nearly 100% when plating on media containing nourseothricin and hygromycin B with transformation efficiencies exceeding 104 homozygous deletion mutants per mg of DNA. A gene reversion system was also employed with plasmids pDUP3 and pDIS3 engineered to contain the ADH1 terminator and an overlap extension PCR-mediated approach combined with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting at the NEUT5 neutral locus. A variety of single or compound mutants (D/Dals3, D/Dcph1 D/Defg1, D/Dece1) and their revertant strains were constructed and phenotypically validated by a variety of assays, including biofilm formation, hyphal growth, and macrophage IL-1b response. Thus, we have established a cloning-free, modular system for highly efficient homozygous gene deletion and reversion in diverse isolates. IMPORTANCE Recently, phenotypic heterogeneity in Candida albicans isolates has been recognized as an underappreciated factor contributing to gene diversification and broadly impacts strain-to-strain antifungal resistance, fitness, and pathogenicity. We have designed a cloning-free genetic system for rapid gene deletion and reversion in C. albicans clinical isolates that interlaces established recyclable genetic systems with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The SAT1-flipper was reengineered to contain CaHygB encoding resistance to hygromycin B. Using a modular PCR-mediated approach coupled with in vitro ribonucleoprotein assembly with commercial reagents, both SAT1- and CaHygB-flipper cassettes were simultaneously integrated at loci with high efficiency (104 transformants per mg DNA) and upward of 99% homozygous gene targeting across a collection of diverse isolates of various anatomical origin. Revertant strains were constructed by overlap extension PCR with CRISPR-Cas9 targeted integration at the NEUT5 locus. Thus, this facile system will aid in unraveling the genetic factors contributing to the complexity of intraspecies diversity. Copyright \u00a9 2022 Liu et al."

Gliotoxin (GT), one of the multiple virulence factors of A. fumigatus, has a variety of immunosuppressive effects. The corpse of an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) was sent for necropsy and diagnostic rule-out. The lungs were enlarged, firm, and had dark-red coloration, on the parietal faces of both lungs, some semi-circular caseous necrosis areas were observed. The caudal thoracic and abdominal air sacs were thickened and contained a fibrin-heterophilic exudate. Histopathologically, a necrotic and granulomatous bronchopneumonia was observed with intralesional hyphae with characteristics compatible with Aspergillus sp. that were positive with Grocott\u00b4s staining. Fibrinous and heterophilic airsacculitis was found in the air sacs. A. fumigatus was isolated from lungs, characterized using serial microcultures, and confirmed using polymerase chain reaction. In addition, GT production was detected in vitro from the culture filtrate in which the isolate was grown; the organic extract was analysed via thin-layer chromatography. This is the first detection of GT in a case of pulmonary aspergillosis in a parrot, which could help to understand the pathogenesis of the disease in psittacines. \u00a9 2022, Brazilian Association of Veterinary Pathology.

The sanitizers were based on the following fungicide molecules, ethanol (ARVO 21 SR), active chlorine (ARVO CLM 600), hydrogen peroxide (Nocolyse Food) and triamine (P3 Topax 960). Food plant spores were produced under a moderate water stress, 0.95 aw and dry-harvested to simulate airborne spores responsible for contamination in the food industry. First, Aspergillus flavus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Mucor circinelloides, and two Penicillium commune isolates were tested against the sanitizers at 20 \u00b0C and at a concentration recommended by the manufacturers. Overall, A. flavus was the less resistant species. Second the effects of concentration and temperature were assessed on the most resistant species, i.e., P. commune UBOCC-A-116003 (ARVO 21 SR and P3 Topax 960), P. commune UBOCC-A-112059 (ARVO CLM 600), and M. circinelloides (Nocolyse Food). With the exception of ARVO 21 SR, the observed inactivation kinetics were downward concave. The time necessary to obtain 4 log reduction, t4D, was estimated by means of the Weibull model. At 20 \u00b0C and at the recommended concentration by the manufacturers, t4D (min) for the most resistant strains were equal to 2.14 (ARVO 21 SR), 7.35 (ARVO CLM 600), 39.3 (Nocolyse Food) and 82.8 (P3 Topax 960). T4D was increased at lower concentrations and temperatures. These effects were more pronounced for ARVO 21 SR, t4D were about 10 fold and 20 fold the above reported value, 2.14 min, at 8 \u00b0C and by diluting the sanitizer by a 10:8 factor, respectively. The least effect of temperature, 3 fold, was shown for ARVO CLM 600, while concentration of P3 Topax 960 had no significant effect on t4D within the recommended utilization range. \u00a9 2022"

Here, we mined our laboratory information management system for such infections in humans and domestic animals for the period 2016\u20132022, including (i) fungal isolates referred for identification and/or susceptibility testing; (ii) infections diagnosed at our laboratory using panfungal PCR approaches on infected tissue; and (iii) organisms cultured in our laboratory from biopsies. In total, 106 cases were retrieved, involving 39 fungal species comprising 26 distinct genera. Subcutaneous infections with Alternaria species were the most frequent (36 cases), which possibly reflects the ubiquitous nature of this common plant pathogen. A substantial proportion of Alternaria spp. isolates exhibited reduced in vitro susceptibility to voriconazole. Notably, a significant number of subcutaneous infections were diagnosed in renal and other solid organ transplant recipients post transplantation, suggesting that humans may harbour \u201cinert\u201d subcutaneous fungal elements from historical minor injuries that present as clinical infections upon later immunosuppression. The current study underscores the diversity of fungi that can cause subcutaneous infections. While most organisms catalogued here were responsible for occasional infections, several genera (Alternaria, Exophiala, Phaeoacremonuim, Scedosporium) were more frequently recovered in our searches, suggesting that they possess virulence factors that facilitate subcutaneous infections and/or inhabit natural niches that make them more likely to be traumatically inoculated. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

The high associated morbidity and mortality with fungal diseases mandate the continued investigation of novel antifungal agents and diagnostic strategies that include surrogate biomarkers. Biologic markers of disease are useful prognostic indicators during clinical care, and their use in place of traditional survival end points may allow for more rapid conduct of clinical trials requiring fewer participants, decreased trial expense, and limited need for long-term follow-up. A number of fungal biomarkers have been developed and extensively evaluated in prospective clinical trials and small series.

Diabetes, immunocompromised states and elevated serum iron levels are the most important risk factors for contracting MCR infection. Recently, MCR co-infections have been observed in patients with COVID-19 disease owing to a complex interplay of metabolic factors and corticosteroid therapy. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is the most common clinical form of MCR infection and refers to infection of the nasal cavities, paranasal sinuses, neck spaces, orbits and intracranial structures. Sinonasal inoculation is typically the primary site of infection; the necrotising and angioinvasive properties of the fungus facilitate its spread into adjacent structures. In this review, we discuss the pertinent mycology and risk factors of MCR infection. The review also aims to acquaint the reader with the cross-sectional imaging appearances of ROCM and its complications. All the cases discussed in this pictorial essay are microbiologically and/or histopathologically proven cases of ROCM with concomitant COVID-19 infection. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

Their applications, however, have often been limited to dry conditions and adhesion of such deformable microfibrils in the fluid environment is less understood. In the present study, we performed adhesion tests in silicone oil using single cylindrical microfibrils of a flat-punch shape with a radius of 80 \u00b5m. Stiff fibrils were created using three-dimensional printing of an elastomeric resin with an elastic modulus of 500 MPa, and soft fibrils, with a modulus of 3.3 MPa, were moulded in polyurethane. Our results suggest that adhesion is dominated by hydrodynamic forces, which can be maximized by stiff materials and high retraction velocities, in line with theoretical predictions. The maximum pull-off stress of stiff cylindrical fibrils is 0.6 MPa, limited by cavitation and viscous fingering, occurring at retraction velocities greater than 2 \u00b5m s\u22121. Next, we add a mushroom cap to the microfibrils, which, in the case of the softer material, deforms upon retraction and leads to a transition to a hydrostatic suction regime with higher pull-off stresses ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 MPa. The effects of elastic modulus, fibril size and viscosity for underwater applications are illustrated in a mechanism map to provide guidance for design optimization. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Thus far, etiological studies were mainly focused on waterlogging effects or on the isolation of microorganisms from diseased plants; therefore, an all-encompassing picture of KVDS microbiota is still missing. This work aims to describe oomycete and fungal communities associated with KVDS and to identify key taxa potentially involved in the disease through a metabarcoding approach on root endosphere and rhizosphere samples. Two nearby fields with similar pedoclimatic conditions were identified based on KVDS spreading during a 4-year survey (2016 to 2019). In total, four sampling areas were selected, one from the control field with no sign of KVDS (asymptomatic site) and three from the KVDS-affected field (diseased site): (i) asymptomatic until the sampling date in 2018, (ii) symptomatic since 2018, and (iii) symptomatic since 2017. Total genomic DNA samples were subjected to a nested PCR approach separately targeting the internal transcribes spacer 2 regions of fungal and oomycete communities. The communities were compared in terms of \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversities, and key taxa were identified using univariate differential abundance tests. Major differences in taxa distribution were observed between samples from the different sites (asymptomatic and diseased) and were mostly linked to the oomycete community. Phytophthora sojae was the main taxa characterizing the diseased site and supposed to be involved in the disease and Phytopythium spp. were found related to the different plant health status. Finally, Dactylonectria macrodidyma, Phytopythium citrinum, and Thielaviopsis basicola were also proposed as new KVDS-related pathogens. \u00a9 2022 The American Phytopathological Society."

            "text": "This study aimed at assessing the impact of the physiological state of fungal spores on inactivation by sodium hypochlorite, 0.1% and 0.2% active chlorine, and 3% hydrogen peroxide. In this context, two physiological states were compared for 4 fungal species (5 strains). The first physiological state corresponded to fungal spores produced at 0.99 aw and harvested using an aqueous solution (laboratory conditions), while the second one corresponded to fungal spores produced under a moderate water stress (0.95 aw) and dry-harvested (mechanical harvesting without use of any water, mimicking food plant conditions). Aspergillus flavus \u201cfood plant\u201d conidia were more resistant to all tested fungicide molecules than the \u201claboratory\u201d ones. The same phenomenon was observed for Penicillium commune UBOCC-A-116003 conidia treated with hydrogen peroxide. However, this isolate did not exhibit any inactivation difference between \u201claboratory\u201d and \u201cfood plant\u201d conidia treated with sodium hypochlorite. Similarly, the physiological state of Cladosporium cladosporioides conidia did not impact the efficacy of the tested biocides. P. commune UBOCC-A-112059 \u201cfood plant\u201d and \u201claboratory\u201d conidia were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite, respectively. As for Mucor circinelloides, \u201claboratory\u201d spores were more resistant to all disinfectant than the \u201cfood plant\u201d ones. Noteworthy, regardless of the physiological state, all M. circinelloides and C. cladosporioides conidia were inactivated for 5 min treatment at 0.2% active chlorine and for 2.5 min treatment at 0.1% active chlorine, while the conidia of all the other species remained viable for these treatments. The obtained data indicate that the efficacy of disinfectant molecules depends not only on the encountered fungal species and its intraspecific diversity but also on the spore physiological state. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe illness with acute respiratory distress requiring critical care in up to 40% of hospitalized patients. Numerous reports have identified COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) as an important infective complication of COVID-19. In the UK, the pandemic has had unprecedented impacts on the National Health Service (NHS'): each wave of infections required hospitals to reconfigure for large surges in patients requiring intensive care, to the detriment of most aspects of non-COVID care including planned operations, outpatient appointments, general practitioner consultations and referrals. The UK National Mycology Reference Laboratory (MRL) offers a comprehensive service for the diagnosis and management of fungal disease nationwide, with a test portfolio that includes: diagnosis of allergies to fungal and other respiratory allergens; diagnosis of superficial and invasive/systemic fungal infections using traditional mycological, serological and molecular approaches; identification and susceptibility testing of the causative fungi; therapeutic drug monitoring of patients receiving antifungal therapy. Here, we describe the impact of the first 14 months of the COVID-19 pandemic on MRL activities. Changes to MRL workload closely mirrored many of the NHS-wide challenges, with marked reductions in 'elective' mycological activities unrelated to the pandemic and dramatic surges in tests that contributed to the diagnosis and management of COVID-19-related secondary fungal infections, in particular CAPA and candidemia in COVID-19 patients in intensive care. Lay summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the UK National Health Service, with hospitals forced to repeatedly reconfigure to prepare for large surges in COVID-19 patients. Here we describe the impact of the first 14 months of the UK pandemic on the workload of the National Mycology Reference Laboratory. \u00a9 2021 Crown copyright."

FungiVision, deployed with a human-in-the-loop, reaches nearly 93% accuracy. Using the collected data, we developed a novel fine-grained classification dataset \u2014 Danish Fungi 2020 (DF20) \u2014 with several unique characteristics: species-level labels, a small number of errors, and rich observation metadata. The dataset enables the testing of the ability to improve classification using metadata, e.g., time, location, habitat and substrate, facilitates classifier calibration testing and finally allows the study of the impact of the device settings on the classification performance. The continual flow of labelled data supports improvements of the online recognition system. Finally, we present a novel method for the fungi recognition service, based on a Vision Transformer architecture. Trained on DF20 and exploiting available metadata, it achieves a recognition error that is 46.75% lower than the current system. By providing a stream of labeled data in one direction, and an accuracy increase in the other, the collaboration creates a virtuous cycle helping both communities. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

Over the course of her, hospitalization, she required multiple debridements and grafting to her lower, extremities; grafted tissue never survived longer than 72 h. Her bilateral lower, extremities began to exhibit visible mold growth. She underwent repeated, debridements down to vitalized tissue only for recurrent necrosis and mold growth to, occur. She underwent serial amputations eventually reaching the level of her midthigh, At this point her clinical condition deteriorated further resulting in multiorgan failure., Ultimately family made the decision to remove her from life support, and she expired, within a few hours. Postmortem analysis identified Rhizopus spp, Fusarium spp, and, Geotrichum candidum. Mucormycosis species are a frequent infector of Cannabis, sativa, which our patient was working with in the inciting explosion. Cutaneous, mucormycosis is a documented but rare manifestation.

Conventional and modern methods accepted in biology and mycology were used. Identification of strains of Beauveria fungi was carried out by determining the direct nucleotide sequence of the TEF region. Laboratory experiments were carried out to evaluate various factors on the diameter of colony growth, survival in deep and surface cultivation, the type of semi-preparative form of the drug based on B. bassiana and the time of its exposure, and the effect on the biological effects of drugs in the field. Statistical data processing was carried out in the R studio program using the P value. The productivity of conidia of entomopathogenic fungi during surface cultivation depended on the type of strain and the duration of cultivation of conidia. The diameter of the growth of Beauveria fungi colonies was influenced by the factors of the strain, the type of nutrient medium, the temperature of colony cultivation, and the number of days after the start of colony cultivation. The survival of conidia of the B. bassiana fungus on the wings of Locusta migratoria L. orrelated with the indicators of cultivation temperature and germination of conidia and cultivation time. The productivity of Beauveria spp. conidia correlate with the type of strain, the type of substrate, and the time of exposure. The conidia continued to germinate on the 25th day. Fungi grew better on a substrate based on millet. In the field, the mortality rate of L. migratoria L. and the biological effectiveness of biopesticides were influenced by the factors of the strain, the form of spraying with the bio preparation, and the time elapsed after treatment with the biopesticide. \u00a9 2022 Ulzhalgas T.

Objectives: To develop a scoring tool to facilitate and quantify adherence to current guideline recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of invasive scedosporiosis and lomentosporiosis. Methods: Experts from European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) excellence centres reviewed current guidelines for scedosporiosis and lomentosporiosis. Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up were summarized, assembled and weighted according to their strength of recommendation and level of evidence (strongly recommended = 3 points; moderately recommended = 2 points; marginally recommended = 1 point; recommended against = 0 points). Additional items considered of high importance for clinical management were also weighted. Results: A total of 170 recommendations were identified. A 21-item tool was developed and embedded into the EQUAL score card. Nine items for diagnosis with 18 achievable points were assembled. For treatment, three general recommendation items with a maximal score of 9 were identified, while for specific antifungal treatment the two fungal pathogens were separated. Three and four items were established for scedosporiosis and lomentosporiosis, respectively, with a maximum achievable score of 3 due to the separation of different treatment options with the maximum point value of 3 for voriconazole-based treatment. Follow-up comprised two items (4 points maximum). Key recommendations for clinical outcome were weighted accordingly. Conclusions: We propose the EQUAL Score Scedosporiosis/Lomentosporiosis to quantify adherence to current guideline recommendations for management of these rare infections. The score remains to be validated in real-life patient cohorts and correlated with patient outcome. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021."

            "text": "Although largely overlooked compared to bacterial infections, fungal infections pose a significant threat to the health of humans and other organisms. Many pathogenic fungi, especially Candida species, are extremely versatile and flexible in adapting to various host niches and stressful situations. This leads to high pathogenicity and increasing resistance to existing drugs. Due to the high level of conservation between fungi and mammalian cells, it is hard to find fungus-specific drug targets for novel therapy development. In this respect, it is vital to understand how these fungi function on a molecular, cellular as well as organismal level. Fluorescence imaging allows for detailed analysis of molecular mechanisms, cellular structures and interactions on different levels. In this manuscript, we provide researchers with an elaborate and contemporary overview of fluorescence techniques that can be used to study fungal pathogens. We focus on the available fluorescent labelling techniques and guide our readers through the different relevant applications of fluorescent imaging, from subcellular events to multispecies interactions and diagnostics. As well as cautioning researchers for potential challenges and obstacles, we offer hands-on tips and tricks for efficient experimentation and share our expert-view on future developments and possible improvements. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

Although antifungal prophylaxis has shown effectiveness in preventing many invasive fungal infections, selective pressure has caused an increase of breakthrough infections caused by Fusarium, Lomentospora, and Scedosporium species, as well as by dematiaceous moulds, Rasamsonia, Schizophyllum, Scopulariopsis, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Talaromyces and Purpureocillium species. Guidance on the complex multidisciplinary management of infections caused by these pathogens has the potential to improve prognosis. Management routes depend on the availability of diagnostic and therapeutic options. The present recommendations are part of the One World-One Guideline initiative to incorporate regional differences in the epidemiology and management of rare mould infections. Experts from 24 countries contributed their knowledge and analysed published evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of rare mould infections. This consensus document intends to provide practical guidance in clinical decision making by engaging physicians and scientists involved in various aspects of clinical management. Moreover, we identify areas of uncertainty and constraints in optimising this management. Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This reactiveness is demonstrated at many levels, from changes in the form of the hypha resulting from alterations in patterns of exocytosis, to membrane excitation, and mechanisms of wound repair. Growing hyphae detect ridges on surfaces and respond to restrictions in their physical space. These are expressions of cellular consciousness. Fungal mycelia show decision-making and alter their developmental patterns in response to interactions with other organisms. Mycelia may even be capable of spatial recognition and learning coupled with a facility for short-term memory.

First of all, may a non-conformity biological analytical (compared to accepted and accredited standards by COFRAC) fail the whole biological expertise, and thereafter, the medico-legal expertise of the file? The answer must consider that the raw result obtained as a result of a medical biology technique must be interpreted and discussed by the expert in the discipline (in this case by the parasitologist) before being included in the medical discussion and discussed by the medical examiner. The judgment is secondarily delivered by the judge according to his intimate conviction and without determining the probative value of the examination. Should a post-mortem biological examination be part of an expertise in medical biology or is it a technical and scientific examination? This answer is based on the previous one, considering the significant contribution of the expert who will bring his knowledge, interpreting and discussing the raw result.

To assess the current state of Medical Mycology support in Germany, we conducted a survey among all 36 academic medical centres. Methods: The survey consisted of a 3-pages questionnaire sent out in the first half of 2019. Information included details of infrastructure, education and teaching; consultation services and interdisciplinary conferences; research activities and participation in network groups; radiology, microbiology and pharmacology support; publication activity; and European Confederation for Medical Mycology (ECMM) Excellence Center designation, if assigned. Results: Information was returned from 24 centres (67%). Thirteen institutions (54%) reported an independent infectious disease, and two a separate Medical Mycology department (8%); a Medical Mycology working group was reported for nine institutions (38%). An infectious disease consultation service was existent in 16 institutions (67%) and a multidisciplinary conference in 13 (54%). Fifteen institutions reported a separate study office with activities in infectious disease studies (63%). Laboratory capability for fungal identification and susceptibility testing was confirmed by all 24 institutions; testing of galactomannan by 23 (96%), cryptococcal antigen by 21 (88%), \u00df-D-Glucan by 9 (38%), and panfungal and Pneumocystis PCR by 21 and 22 (88% and 92%), respectively. Therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole was reported to be available in 15 (63%) institutions with a turnaround of \u226424\u00a0h during weekdays in 10 (42%). Two of the 24 University hospitals (8%) reported ECMM Diamond Excellence Status. Conclusions: The results of this survey document the continuing need to improve the availability of specialised Medical Mycology support in German academic medical centres. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Candida albicans is a common commensal fungus that gives rise to local and systemic infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients where it can result in mortality. However, C. albicans has also been quietly linked with a variety of inflammatory disorders, to which it has traditionally been considered incidental; recent studies may now provide new aspects of these relationships for further consideration. This review provides a novel perspective on the impact of C. albicans and its peptide toxin, candidalysin, on human health, exploring their contributions to pathology within a variety of diseases. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Bacteriological, mycological and cytological investigations are the backbone of detecting endometritis in mares. Interleukin-6, Prostaglandin E2 and Prostaglandin F2\u03b1 are pro-inflammatory cytokines and their determination in serum of mares is important to predict early stages of endometritis to prevent its detrimental effect on fertility of mares. Low volume lavage (LVL) fluid was microbiologically examined (bacteria and fungi) together with cytological smears from endometrial swabs. Microbial growth on culture of the LVL pellet revealed that diseased mares had Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli (75%), Klebsiella spp. (40%), Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (60%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (55%). For mycological results; there were 25 (25%) diseased mares showed positive results for yeasts and moulds as 13 were positive for yeasts and 12 for moulds. Microbial examination together with cytological results revealed that endometritis was diagnosed in 80 out of 100 mares. Serum evaluation of IL6, PGE2 and PGF2\u03b1 revealed their higher levels in diseased mares (83%) compared with control ones. In conclusion, microbiological examination of endometrial Low volume uterine lavage is of great importance to diagnose precisely the causative agent either bacteria or fungi. Microbiological together with cytological smears and clinical finding are crucial when evaluating mares. The IL6, PGE2 and PGF2\u03b1 determination in serum can detect early stages of endometritis to quickly treat those cases. \u00a9 2021 Soliman et al.

In 2019, two samples of both soil and roots were collected from a vineyard in Delano, Kern County, California and submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture, ARS, Mycology and Nematology Genetic Diversity and Biology Laboratory, Beltsville, MD, for identification purposes. Females and juveniles of Pratylenchus sp. were recovered from the root and soil samples using the sugar centrifugal flotation and Baermann funnel extraction methods. Both morphological observations and molecular analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 28S large subunit ribosomal DNA, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) sequences indicated that the specimens recovered from the soil and roots were Pratylenchus hippeastri. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of P. hippeastri from California including the first record of this species on grapevine and the second state record in North America. Damages caused by nematodes cannot be over-emphasized, although economic importance of P. hippeastri has never been established. Hence, there is an urgent need to investigate the economic impact of this nematode in vineyards in California State in order to develop sustainable management strategies.  \u00a9 2020 Authors."

The study provided the relevant information for the years 2019 and 2020 and included data from all units, concerning culture-based methods and direct microscopy, phenotypic and molecular identification, sensitivity testing, serology and molecular diagnosis, as well as therapeutic drug monitoring. The target was mostly to reveal the level of laboratory coverage for hospitalised paediatric patients, independently of the possibility of performing the tests in the host hospital, or otherwise to refer the specimens elsewhere. In total, the current study demonstrated that the most important facilities and services regarding the IFD diagnostics for paediatric haematology-oncology patients in Greece are available and relatively easily accessible, with a reasonable turnaround time. Acting as an initial registry for further improvements, the audit can serve as a valuable approach to the actual situation and future perspectives. A national clinical mycology network under the auspices of the relevant scientific societies will probably facilitate collaboration between all the departments (clinical and laboratory) involved in invasive fungal infections and provide an easier approach to any necessary test for any hospitalised patient. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

            "text": "Background: Dermatophytosis is a common problem across the globe that is caused by a group of closely related fungi known as the dermatophytes that can invade keratinized tissues. It is a usual refractory infection and deleteriously affects the quality of life of humans. Despite the common presence of dermatophytes on the human host, research evidence in this area is limited. Objective: Aimed to assess the mycological profile and its associated factors among patients suspected of dermatophytosis at Bisidimo Hospital, Eastern Ethiopia, from March to October 2021. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 289 patients who visited the dermatology department of Bisidimo Hospital. Data were collected by reviewing patients\u2019 charts and using a structured questionnaire to assess the associated factors of dermatophytosis. The patients\u2019 medical charts were reviewed to assess chronic conditions. Skin, hair, or nail samples were collected and transported to Medical Microbiology Laboratory at Haramaya University Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences. Samples were inoculated into Potato dextrose agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar, and fungal isolates were identified morphologi-cally and microscopically. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses with 95% confidence intervals were carried out to identify factors associated with dermatophytosis. Results: The overall magnitude of dermatophytosis infection was 28.4% (95%CI: 23.2\u2013 32.2). Tinea capitis and tinea corporis were the common clinical presentations. The fungal isolates include Trichophyton species (68 isolates) and Epidermophyton species (17 isolates). Patients with features involving male sex (AOR = 2.5), age group of 1\u201310 years (AOR = 3.5), hypertension (AOR = 2.2), a family history of dermatophytosis (AOR = 2.0), and a history of animal contact (AOR = 1.5) had the increased odds of being infected with the dermatophytosis. Conclusion: We found more than one in four patients assessed had dermatophytosis infection. It was considerably high in patients with a family history of the infection, animal contacts, hypertension, and below 10 years of age. Therefore, the control program for this disease should specifically target at a high risk populations, which must hinge on the evidence of molecular characterization and antifungal susceptibility patterns of the fungi. \u00a9 2021 Ali Dawa et al."

            "text": "The frequency and variety of infections caused by fungi are increasing. However, changes and intercenter and regional differences are observed in the distribution of fungal species over the years. It is important to update the epidemiological data in order to enable early and appropriate treatment. In this retrospective study, the number of fungi isolated from clinical samples, their distribution at the genus/ species level and the variations over the years in Hacettepe University hospital which is a regional center for patients at risk of fungal infection were investigated. For this purpose, laboratory records from 2008- 2019 were examined and 21813 fungal strains isolated from 19636 clinical samples were detected. When the first (2008-2013) and second (2014-2019) six-year periods were compared, a 2.5 fold increase was observed in the number of specimens yielding fungal growth (first period; n= 5620, second period; n= 14016). Fungi were most frequently isolated from urine (45.0%), lower respiratory tract (30.7%) and blood (6.8%) samples. Mould isolation rate in all samples increased significantly in the second six-year period (from 8.3% to 10.6%, p\u2264 0.001). As expected, the most frequent yeast was Candida albicans (57.0%) and mould was Aspergillus fumigatus complex (50.4%). In the second six-year period, isolation of C.albicans (59.3% to 56.0%, p\u2264 0.001) among yeasts and A.fumigatus complex (58.1% to 48.0%, p\u2264 0.001) among moulds decreased significantly. In urine specimens, most common fungi were C.albicans (49.8%), Candida glabrata complex (15.6%), Candida tropicalis (8.9%) and Candida kefyr (7.5%). In lower respiratory tract specimens, the most common mould was A.fumigatus complex (51.2%), which has decreased from 63.7% in the first six years to 47.1% in the second period (p\u2264 0.001). Over the same period, other Aspergillus species (from 25.5% to 34.1%, p= 0.002) and non-Aspergillus moulds (from 36.3% to 52.9%, p\u2264 0.001) were increased. In blood samples, C.albicans (44.4%), Candida parapsilosis complex (21.5%) and C.glabrata complex (13.0%) were the most frequent species. In the second six-year period, the frequency of C.albicans decreased from 47.3% to 42.2% (p= 0.059) and the frequency of C.glabrata complex increased from 9.5% to 15.5% (p\u2264 0.001) when compared to the first period. For the sterile specimens other than blood, the most common species were C.albicans (37.8%), C.glabrata complex (9.1%) and C.parapsilosis complex (4.7%). However, the number of fungal isolates and the distribution of the species showed great variation over the years. In our center, a substantial increase in the number of fungal strains isolated from the clinical specimens were observed over a 12-years period. In addition and similar to previously published reports, the increase of strains belonging to species with decreased antifungal susceptibility and/or species with unknown susceptibility were detected. The use of local data is required in order to implement early and appropriate antifungal treatment because of inter-center and regional differences observed in epidemiological trends regarding the distributions of fungal genera and species. Surveillance studies to be conducted with the participation of large and sufficient numbers of centers in our country, as we have done for our center, will also contribute to approaches regarding the management of fungal infections by revealing the epidemiological data in a comprehensive manner. \u00a9 2021 Ankara Microbiology Society.

            "text": "Background and Purpose: Malassezia yeasts are lipophilic normal flora of the skin in humans and other warm-blooded vertebrates. This genus includes 18 species and is responsible for dermatological disorders, such as pityriasis versicolor, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis, and dandruff. The aim of the present study was to identify the etiologic agents of Malassezia infections among the patients referring to the Referral Dermatology Clinic of Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, during 2018-2019. Materials and Methods: For the purpose of the study, clinical specimens, including skin scrapings and dandruff, were collected and subjected to direct microscopy, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing. Direct PCR was performed on the clinical samples to amplify the D1/D2 region of 26S rDNA, using specific primers; subsequently, the amplicons were sent for sequencing. Results: This study was conducted on 120 patients with suspected pityriasis versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis, who referred to the Referral Dermatology Clinic of Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, during 2018-2019. Out of this population, 50 (41.7%), 26 (52%), and 24 (48%) cases had Malassezia infection, pityriasis versicolor, and seborrheic dermatitis, respectively. Malassezia globosa was found to be the most prevalent species (n=29, 58%), followed by M. restricta (n=20, 40%), and M. arunalokei (n=1, 2%). Conclusion: The epidemiologic study was indicative of the frequency of some Malassezia species, such as M. globosa and M. restricta, in Isfahan, Iran. It can be concluded that direct PCR on clinical samples could be used as a simple, precise, effective, fast, and affordable method for research and even routine medical mycology laboratory studies.

We report the antifungal activity guided isolation and identification of substances from aerial parts of this species, both individually and in combination with fluconazole (FLU), against Candida albicans strains. Two antifungal flavanones were identified as naringenin (NAR) and pinocembrin (PIN). These compounds could individually inhibit the growth of C. albicans strains. Combinations of NAR and PIN with FLU were synergistic against the FLU resistant and sensitive C. albicans strains. Genotoxic and cytotoxic evaluations were also performed. NAR, PIN and their combinations with FLU did not have a genotoxic effect on Bacillus subtilis rec strains. Finally, these compounds did not show cytotoxicity at concentrations below 80 \u03bcg/mL. \u00a9 2020"

However, despite being the subject of several mycology studies, they focus primarily on exploiting their antimicrobial activity, lacking information on the mechanisms of action of PE on Candida spp., characterizing its antifungal potential. Aim of the study: To elucidate the bioactivity of PE on the cellular structure of Candida albicans. Materials and methods: A total of seven C. albicans clinical isolates plus a reference strain of C. albicans ATCC 90028 were used in this study. The PE was characterized and its effect on C. albicans was determined by susceptibility and growth kinetics assays; interference on C. albicans germination and filamentation; evaluation of the integrity of the C. albicans cell wall and membrane, as well as its mutagenic potential. Results: The PE presented strong inhibitory activity, which showed its greatest antifungal activity at 12 h with dose and time dependent fungistatic characteristics, effectively inhibiting and interfering on C. albicans filamentation. In addition, PE caused membrane and cell wall damage with intracellular content extravasation. Moreover, PE was not mutagenic. Conclusions: The bioactivity of PE is mainly related to the loss of integrity membrane as well as the integrity of the cell wall and consequent increase in permeability, without mutagenic effects. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V."

The mainstay microbial culture is time-consuming and constrained by variable growth requirements. In this study, we explored the use of Nanopore sequencing as a supplementary tool to alleviate this diagnostic bottleneck. Methods: We developed a targeted Nanopore method based on amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer region. The performance was compared with routine infectious disease workups on 43 respiratory specimens. Results: Nanopore successfully identified majority of microbes (47/54, 87.04%) and 7 possible pathogens not detected by routine workups, which were attributable to the content of microbiological investigations (n = 5) and negative culture (n = 2). The average sequencing time for first target reads was 7 min (1-43 min) plus 5 h of pre-sequencing preparation. Conclusions: The Nanopore method described here was rapid, economical and hypothesis-free, which might provide valuable hints to further microbiological follow-up for opportunistic pathogens missed or not detectable by conventional tests. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)."

L. willkommii was first detected in Massachusetts, North America in 1927 on a larch plantation cultivated with nursery stock imported from Great Britain. Despite the decades of practices aimed at eliminating the pathogen, it has reappeared in coastal areas of Canada and the United States. There is concern ELC could spread throughout the range of eastern larch, a transcontinental species typical of the Boreal forest that spans the North American landscape. There is geographic range overlap between several nonpathogenic indigenous Lachnellula species and the reported distribution of L. willkommii in North America. Morphological and biological methods to distinguish L. willkommii are often inadequate as the fungus does not always produce the phenotypic structures that distinguish it from these other saprophytic Lachnellula species. Whole genome sequencing technologies were used to obtain the draft genome sequences of L. willkommii and six other Lachnellula species. Molecular markers identified from the genomic data may be used to discriminate L. willkommii from its nonpathogenic relatives. \u00a9 2020 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada."

Urgent surgical and medical intervention is lifesaving. Guidance on the complex multidisciplinary management has potential to improve prognosis, but approaches differ between health-care settings. From January, 2018, authors from 33 countries in all United Nations regions analysed the published evidence on mucormycosis management and provided consensus recommendations addressing differences between the regions of the world as part of the \u201cOne World One Guideline\u201d initiative of the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM). Diagnostic management does not differ greatly between world regions. Upon suspicion of mucormycosis appropriate imaging is strongly recommended to document extent of disease and is followed by strongly recommended surgical intervention. First-line treatment with high-dose liposomal amphotericin B is strongly recommended, while intravenous isavuconazole and intravenous or delayed release tablet posaconazole are recommended with moderate strength. Both triazoles are strongly recommended salvage treatments. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is recommended against, because of substantial toxicity, but may be the only option in resource limited settings. Management of mucormycosis depends on recognising disease patterns and on early diagnosis. Limited availability of contemporary treatments burdens patients in low and middle income settings. Areas of uncertainty were identified and future research directions specified. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

In our study, we compared the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the stipe and cap of the fruiting body by high-throughput proteomics. GO and pathway analysis revealed the great differences in the metabolic levels, including sucrose and starch metabolism, and sphingolipid signaling and metabolism, and the differences of 16 important DEPs were validated further by qPCR analysis in expression level. In order to control the cap and stipe development, several chemical inducers were applied to the primordium of the fruiting body according to the pathway enrichment results. We found that CaCl2 can affect the primordium differentiation through inhibiting the stipe development. EGTA (ethyleneglycol bis (\u03b2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid) treatment confirmed the inhibitory role of Ca2+ in the stipe development. Our study not only shows great metabolic differences during the cap and stipe development but also reveals the underlying mechanism directing the primordium differentiation in the early development of the fruiting body for the first time. Most importantly, we provide a reliable application strategy for the cultivation and improvement of the Pleurotus ostreatus, which can be an example and reference for a more edible fungus. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

Colonization on both biotic (patients) and abiotic (health care objects) surfaces, along with travel, appear to be the major factors for the spread of this pathogen across the globe. In this investigation, we present laboratory findings from an ongoing C. auris outbreak in New York (NY) from August 2016 through 2018. A total of 540 clinical isolates, 11,035 patient surveillance specimens, and 3,672 environmental surveillance samples were analyzed. Laboratory methods included matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for yeast isolate identification, real-time PCR for rapid surveillance sample screening, culture on selective/nonselective media for recovery of C. auris and other yeasts from surveillance samples, antifungal susceptibility testing to determine the C. auris resistance profile, and Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and D1/D2 regions of the ribosomal gene for C. auris genotyping. Results included (a) identification and confirmation of C. auris in 413 clinical isolates and 931 patient surveillance isolates as well as identification of 277 clinical cases and 350 colonized cases from 151 health care facilities, including 59 hospitals, 92 nursing homes, 1 long-term acute care hospital (LTACH), and 2 hospices, (b) successful utilization of an in-house developed C. auris real-time PCR assay for the rapid screening of patient and environmental surveillance samples, (c) demonstration of relatively heavier colonization of C. auris in nares than in the axilla/groin, and (d) predominance of the South Asia clade I with intrinsic resistance to fluconazole and elevated MIC to voriconazole (81%), amphotericin B (61%), flucytosine (5FC) (3%), and echinocandins (1%). These findings reflect greater regional prevalence and incidence of C. auris and the deployment of better detection tools in an unprecedented outbreak. \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

This study compiles previously unpublished data from echinocandin susceptibility testing of UK clinical isolates of C. glabrata received at the Public Health England Mycology Reference Laboratory from 2003 to 2016 and reevaluates the prevalence of resistance in light of currently accepted testing protocols. From 2015 onward, FKS gene mutation detection using a novel Pyrosequencing\u00ae assay was assessed as a predictor of echinocandin resistance alongside conventional susceptibility testing. Overall, our data show that echinocandin resistance in UK isolates of C. glabrata is a rare phenomenon and prevalence has not appreciably increased in the last 14 years. The pyrosequencing assay was able to successfully detect hot spot mutations in FKS1 and FKS2, although not all isolates that exhibited phenotypic resistance demonstrated detectable hot spot mutations. We propose that a rapid genomic based detection method for FKS mutations, as part of a multifactorial approach to susceptibility testing, could help provide accurate and timely management decisions especially in regions where echinocandin resistance has been reported to be emerging in this important pathogen. \u00a9 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, sanitary and physiological quality of seeds are fundamental for the uniform establishment of the crops in the field, being one of the factors that ensure success of the production. The objective of this work was to estimate the incidence and characterize the Alternaria fungus occurring in parsley cv. 'Grauda Portuguesa' seeds. The incidence analysis was performed using the blotter test method, employing four replicates (50 seeds per gerbox). After 10 days at 25 \u00baC and 12 h photoperiod of light, the evaluation was performed by examining individually all seeds in a stereoscope microscope aiming to make semi-permanent slides moutings, which was performed by removing mycelium and fungal structures found on infected seeds, in order to characterize and identify the incident fungal species. The conidia showed dimensions of 21.3 - 37.6 x 6.2 - 13.9 \u03bcm (28.8 x 10.9 \u03bcm), inverted pear shape, light brown and beaks of 4.0 \u2013 13.8 \u03bcm (7.7 \u03bcm), with presence of 1-3 longitudinal and 2-4 transverse septa. These morphological markers led to an identification of the fungus as A. alternata, with incidence of 70%. \u00a9 2019 Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul. All Rights Reserved."

            "text": "A B S T R A C T Fungal keratitis is a common but severe eye infection in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. In regions with a temperate climate, the frequency of infection is rising in patients with contact lenses and following trauma. Early and adequate therapy is important to prevent disease progression and loss of vision. The management of Fusarium keratitis is complex, and the optimal treatment is not well defined. We investigated the in vitro activity of chlorhexidine and seven antifungal agents against a well-characterized collection of Fusarium isolates recovered from patients with Fusarium keratitis. The fungus culture collection of the Center of Expertise in Mycology Radboudumc/CWZ was searched for Fusarium isolates that were cultured from cornea scrapings, ocular biopsy specimens, eye swabs, and contact lens fluid containers from patients with suspected keratitis. The Fusarium isolates that were cultured from patients with confirmed keratitis were all identified using conventional and molecular techniques. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the EUCAST broth microdilution reference method. The antifungal agents tested included amphotericin B, voriconazole, posaconazole, miconazole, natamycin, 5-fluorocytosine, and caspofungin. In addition, the activity of chlorhexidine was determined. The fungal culture collection contained 98 Fusarium isolates of confirmed fungal keratitis cases from 83 Dutch patients and 15 Tanzanian patients. The isolates were collected between 2007 and 2017. Fusarium oxysporum (n 24, 24.5%) was the most frequently isolated species followed by Fusarium solani sensu stricto (n 18, 18.4%) and Fusarium petroliphilum (n 11, 11.2%). Amphotericin B showed the most favorable in vitro inhibition of Fusarium species followed by natamycin, voriconazole, and chlorhexidine, while 5-fluorocytosine, posaconazole, miconazole, and caspofungin showed no relevant inhibiting effect. However, chlorhexidine showed fungicidal activity against 90% of F. oxysporum strains and 100% of the F. solani strains. Our study supports the clinical efficacy of chlorhexidine and therefore warrants its further clinical evaluation for primary therapy of fungal keratitis, particularly in low and middle income countries where fungal keratitis is much more frequent and, currently, antifungal eye drops are often unavailable.

In the near horizon, the prevalence of fungal diseases is likely to increase, as there will be more hosts with impaired immunity and drug resistance will inevitably increase after selection by antifungal drug use. We can expect progress in the development of new drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and immunotherapies. In the far horizon, humanity may face new fungal diseases in association with climate change. Some current associations between chronic diseases and fungal infections could lead to the establishment of fungi as causative agents, which will greatly enhance their medical importance. All trends suggest that the importance of fungal diseases will increase in the 21st century, and enhanced human preparedness for this scourge will require more research invest-ment in this group of infectious diseases. \u00a9 Pathogens and Immunity 2018."

Several clinical risk factors are described to predispose to fungal disease, particularly in immunocompromised and severely ill patients. However, these alone do not entirely explain why, under comparable clinical conditions, only some patients develop infection. Recent clinical and epidemiological studies have reported an expanding number of monogenic defects and common polymorphisms associated with fungal disease. By directly implicating genetic variation in the functional regulation of immune mediators and interacting pathways, these studies have provided critical insights into the human immunobiology of fungal disease. Most of the common genetic defects reported were described or suggested to impair fungal recognition by the innate immune system. Here, we review common genetic variation in pattern recognition receptors and its impact on the immune response against the two major fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. In addition, we discuss potential strategies and opportunities for the clinical translation of genetic information in the field of medical mycology. These approaches are expected to transfigure current clinical practice by unleashing an unprecedented ability to personalize prophylaxis, therapy and monitoring for fungal disease. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018."

The bisexual and unisexual cycles of pathogenic Cryptococcus species are stimulated by properties associated with their environmental niches and proceed through well-characterized signaling pathways and corresponding morphological changes. Genes governing mating are encoded by the mating-type (MAT) loci and influence pathogenesis, population dynamics, and lineage divergence in Cryptococcus. MAT has undergone significant evolutionary changes within the Cryptococcus genus, including transition from the ancestral tetrapolar state in nonpathogenic species to a bipolar mating system in pathogenic species, as well as several internal reconfigurations. Owing to the variety of established sexual reproduction mechanisms and the robust characterization of the evolution of mating and MAT in this genus, Cryptococcus species provide key insights into the evolution of sexual reproduction. \u00a9 2019 Annual Reviews Inc..

            "text": "The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans requires respiratory function for normal growth, morphogenesis, and virulence. Mitochondria therefore represent an enticing target for the development of new antifungal strategies. This possibility is bolstered by the presence of characteristics specific to fungi. However, respiration in C. albicans, as in many fungal organisms, is facilitated by redundant electron transport mechanisms, making direct inhibition a challenge. In addition, many chemicals known to target the electron transport chain are highly toxic. Here we made use of chemicals with low toxicity to efficiently inhibit respiration in C. albicans. We found that use of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and of the alternative oxidase inhibitor salicyl-hydroxamic acid (SHAM) prevents respiration and leads to a loss of viability and to cell wall rearrangements that increase the rate of uptake by macrophages in vitro and in vivo. We propose that treatment with SNP plus SHAM (SNP+SHAM) leads to transcriptional changes that drive cell wall rearrangement but which also prime cells to activate the transition to hyphal growth. In line with this, we found that pretreatment of C. albicans with SNP+SHAM led to an increase in virulence. Our data reveal strong links between respiration, cell wall remodeling, and activation of virulence factors. Our findings demonstrate that respiration in C. albicans can be efficiently inhibited with chemicals that are not damaging to the mammalian host but that we need to develop a deeper understanding of the roles of mitochondria in cellular signaling if they are to be developed successfully as a target for new antifungals. IMPORTANCE Current approaches to tackling fungal infections are limited, and new targets must be identified to protect against the emergence of resistant strains. We investigated the potential of targeting mitochondria, which are organelles required for energy production, growth, and virulence, in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Our findings suggest that mitochondria can be targeted using drugs that can be tolerated by humans and that this treatment enhances their recognition by immune cells. However, release of C. albicans cells from respiratory inhibition appears to activate a stress response that increases the levels of traits associated with virulence. Our results make it clear that mitochondria represent a valid target for the development of antifungal strategies but that we must determine the mechanisms by which they regulate stress signaling and virulence ahead of successful therapeutic advance. \u00a9 2019 Duvenage et al."

This study uses molecular age estimation using sequence data from multiple loci, and cophylogeny reconciliation analyses to test hypotheses regarding how the aecial and telial stages in the lifecycle of rust fungi may have differentially impacted their diversification. Molecular age estimates show that the timing of diversification in the Pucciniales correlates with the diversification of their gymnosperm and angiosperm hosts. Host reconciliation analyses suggest that systematic relationships of hosts from the aecial stage of the Pucciniales lifecycle better reflect the systematic relationships among the Pucciniales. The results demonstrate the relative importance of this stage on the overall evolution of the Pucciniales and supports hypotheses made by Leppik over half a century ago.

            "text": "Background: Blood eosinophilia is a common laboratory abnormality, and its characterization frequently represents a quandary for primary care physicians. Consequently, in France, specialists and particularly hematologists, often must investigate patients who present with blood eosinophilia that often, but not always, occurs because of allergic causes. Both the Departments of Hematology and Parasitology at Toulouse University Hospitals established a collaboration to rule out allergic causes of eosinophilia, particularly helminthiases, prior to initiating more sophisticated investigations. Methods: Since 2004, the authors employed the same protocol to investigate eosinophilic outpatients who attended the clinic of Parasitology at Toulouse University Hospitals, and they reported the performance of this diagnostic procedure that was designed to be rapid (no hospitalization required) and only moderately expensive. Results: A total of 406 patients who presented with blood eosinophilia greater than 0.5 (\u00d7109, giga cells per litter, G/L) had an allergic etiology in 350 (86.2%) cases. Among the remaining 56 subjects, 17 did not undergo a follow-up and 39 were referred to another specialized department, mostly Hematology. However, only 21 patients attended then were subsequently investigated. Non-allergic causes of eosinophilia, including 3 cases of the lymphoid variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome and 2 cases of myeloproliferative disorder, were identified in 14 patients, whereas 7 remained diagnosed as having idiopathic eosinophilia. Conclusion: This study underlines the need to investigate patients presenting with even moderate blood eosinophilia. The work-up that was employed appears to be efficient and versatile and may be used by any medical specialist, such as in hematology, infectious disease, or internal medicine departments, who needs to investigate eosinophilic patients and should initially rule out any etiology of allergic eosinophilia. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s)."

These organisms cause severe mycoses in immunosuppressed individuals, such as those: (a) with AIDS; (b) having undergone transplantation; and/or (c) undergoing chemotherapy. Immunocompetent people can become infected. Some FFHP are isolated from foods which may be fomites. However, the information concerning particular species on specific food is large, dispersed and difficult to obtain. Reports of filamentous fungi from food/crops and causing human disease are frequently only available in the literature of food mycology/plant pathology and medical mycology, respectively: it is seldom cross-referenced. Aspergillus contains some species with strains that are the most dangerous FFHP, with Aspergillus fumigatus causing the most serious diseases. Fusarium and Mucor also contain species of high importance and approximately 15 other genera are involved. A checklist and database of FFHP species isolated from food is presented herein with emphasis on Aspergillus, Fusarium and Mucor in summary tables to increase awareness of the connection between food and FFHP. Metadata on all FFHP is provided in a large supplementary table for updating and revision when necessary. Previous names of fungi have been revised to reflect current valid usage whenever appropriate. The information will form a foundation for future research and taxonomic revisions in the field. The paper will be highly useful for medical practitioners, food mycologists, fungal taxonomists, patients, regulators and food producers interested in reducing infectious diseases and producing high quality food. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.

Methods and Results: A full factorial design was used in which two factors were assayed: pH and aW. The aW levels assayed were 0\u00b780, 0\u00b785, 0\u00b790, 0\u00b792, 0\u00b794, 0\u00b796, 0\u00b798 and 0\u00b799. The levels of pH assayed were 3\u00b75, 4, 4\u00b75, 5, 6, 7, 7\u00b75 and 8. The assay was performed at normal oxygen tension at 25 and 37\u00b0C, and at reduced oxygen tension at 25\u00b0C. Two strains of A. fumigatus isolated from corn silage were used. Kinetic models were built to predict growth of the strain under the assayed conditions. The cardinal models gave a good quality fit for radial growth rate data. The results indicate that the environmental conditions which take place during silage production, while limiting the growth of most micro-organisms, would not be able to control A. fumigatus. Moreover, pH levels in silage, far from limiting its growth, are also close to its optimum. Carbon dioxide at 5% in the environment did not significantly affect its growth. Conclusions: A need for a further and controlled acidification of the silage exists, as no growth of A. fumigatus was observed at pH 3\u00b75, as long as the organoleptic characteristics of the silage are not much compromised. Significance and Impact of the Study: Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the major opportunistic pathogens able to cause illness such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis to rural workers. Exposure of animals to A. fumigatus spores can result in infections, particularly in those organs exposed to external invasion, such as the airways, mammary gland and uterus at birth. \u00a9 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology"

Material and Methods: 481 medical records of outpatients referred to the Medical Mycology Department were reviewed since 2009 to 2016. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: 47 (9.77%) cases had oral manifestations, 29 (61.70%) were associated to PCM and 18 (38.29%) to histoplasmosis. For PCM, male-female ratio was 8:1 and 1:1 for histoplasmosis. The average age for PCM was 48 years old and 53 for histoplasmosis. All the PCM patients had more than 1 oral structure affected: 44.82% were gingival lesions and 27.58% palate. In patients with histoplasmosis, 6 (33.33%) were lesions affecting palate and 6 (33.33%) involving tongue. For both entities, painful ulcers and granulomatous-like lesions were the most prevalent clinical forms; however, we observed a wide range of other oral manifestations. Regarding PCM patient\u2019s comorbidities, 3 (10.34%) cases had HIV/AIDS, 8 (27.58%) histoplasmosis and 2 (6.89%) carcinomas. Whereas the comorbidities of patients with histoplasmosis, 2 (11.11%) had HIV/AIDS and 1 (5.55%) had carcinoma. Conclusion: In endemic countries for both mycoses, dentists must be aware of patients with mouth lesions, take advantage of epidemiologic clues that suggest risk factors and be acquainted with all the current diagnostic tests in order to make a quick diagnosis and treatment in highly suspicious cases. \u00a9 2018, Association of Support to Oral Health Research (APESB).

Methodology. Molecular identification was carried out by analysing the IGS1 regions of the rDNA of 30 Trichosporon isolates. Results. Trichosporon asahii was the most frequent species detected. Furthermore, four genotypes were identified in Tunisia: 1 (46.4 %), 4 (35.7 %), 7 (14.3 %) and 3 (3.6 %). In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of the isolates showed that voriconazole exhibited the highest activity. Conclusion. This is the first reported study of genotype identification of T. asahii in Tunisia and even in the African continent. \u00a9 2017 The Authors."

This systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed the literature for the prevalence and diversity of fungi in root canal infections. An extensive literature search was carried out in the Cochrane databases, EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS, SciELO and Web of Science. Additional studies were identified from six endodontic journals, four main endodontic textbooks and references of relevant papers. Selected clinical studies included sampling of necrotic pulps in permanent teeth and microbial analysis of these samples. Studies were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Checklist. Meta-analysis was performed using MetaXL. The screening of 1041 titles and abstracts and full-text reading yielded 54 studies. The overall prevalence of fungi in root canal infections was 7.5% (CI 95%: 3.6\u201311.8%) in the inverse variance fixed effect heterogeneity model. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species. Significant heterogeneity was observed (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, I2\u00a0=\u00a085.04%). Subgroup analyses based on geographical location, period of publication, type of infection, state of general health, communication with the oral cavity, type of sample and identification method revealed no factor influencing the prevalence. Better standardized techniques and a comprehensive analysis will reveal a more detailed and accurate representation of the prevalence and nature of fungi in root canal infections. \u00a9 2016 International Endodontic Journal.

We here give a brief review of the use of the Drosophila model in medical mycology, discuss the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the opportunistic human pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus, and give a brief summary of what is known about the toxicity of some common fungal VOCs. Further, we discuss the use of VOC detection as an indirect indicator of fungal growth, including for early diagnosis of aspergillosis. Finally, we hypothesize that D. melanogaster has promise for investigating the role of VOCs synthesized by A. fumigatus as possible virulence factors.  \u00a9 The Korean Society of Mycology."

            "text": "Background: Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex is a heterogeneous group. A new classification, based on molecular biology, has replaced the one based on morphology, physiology, and mating behavior. Objective: T. mentagrophytes isolates from Korean patients were classified using the new method and compared with the classic classification. Methods: During 2010-2011, fungal isolates were collected at the Catholic skin clinic from 562 patients infected with T. mentagrophytes; clinical characteristics were reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups based on the morphological characteristics of the isolates. Thirty-four strains of T. mentagrophytes were randomly selected from the four groups for mycological and molecular biology analyses, including analyses of morphological characteristics, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence, and rDNA nontranscribed spacer (NTS) typing. Results: Among the 562 isolates, persicolor (41.6%) was the most common strain type, followed by the powdery (38.4%), downy (11.2%), and granular (8.7%) types. The granular type differed from the other three with respect to the isolation site, patient's age, seasonal variation, and microscopic characteristics. Among the selected 34 strains, the microscopic characteristics varied for each strain. The powdery, persicolor, and downy types had ITS sequences identical to those of the anthropophilic T. interdigitale/A. vanbreuseghemii. The ITS sequence of granular type was similar to that of zoophilic T. interdigitale/A. vanbreuseghemii. The granular type had different NTS types than the other types did. Conclusion: The T. mentagrophytes strains isolated were classified as T. interdigitalelA. vanbreuseghemii; the majority (91.7%) was anthropophilic and 8.3% were zoophilic and granular type.

Crude extracted from endophytic fungus JAS-2 was purified and chemically characterized by chromatographic and spectroscopic studies respectively. Spectral assignment of NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) data, 1H proton and 13C carbon analysis along with FTIR data elucidated the structure of compound as 4,5-Dihydroxy-3-(1-propenyl)-2-cyclopenten-1-one. After purification and identification a set of experiment was conducted to explore efficacy of compound. Results revealed that on accessing the antifungal activity of compound, growth diameter of tested phytopathogenic fungi was reduced to 50% at higher concentration taken (10 \u03bcg\u03bcl-1). Compound exhibited in-vitro bacterial cell inhibition at 20 \u03bcgml-1 concentration along with moderate antioxidant behavior. Evaluation of anticancer activity against human lung cancer cell line (A-549) exhibited its IC50 value to be 121.9 \u00b1 4.821 \u03bcgml-1. Further cell cycle phase distribution were analyzed on the basis of DNA content and evaluated by FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting) and it was revealed that at 150 \u03bcgml-1 of compound maximum cells were found in sub G1 phase which represents apoptotic dead cells. Terrein (4, 5-Dihydroxy-3-(1-propenyl)-2-cyclopenten-1-one) a multi-potential was isolated from endophytic fungus JAS-2, from well recognized medicinal herb A. aspera. To best of our knowledge, this is the first report of \"Terrein\" from endophytic derived fungus. This compound had also exhibited anticancer and antifungal activity against human lung cancer cell line A-549 and Bipolaris sorokiniana respectively which is causal organism of many plants disease. Hence endophytes are serving as alternative sources of drug molecules. \u00a9 2017 Goutam, Sharma, Tiwari, Mishra, Kharwar, Ramaraj and Koch."

Rapid detection and identification of Aspergillus spp. facilitate effective patient management. In the current study we compared conventional morphological methods with PCR sequencing, rep-PCR, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the identification of Aspergillus strains. Materials and Methods: A total of 24 consecutive clinical isolates of Aspergillus were collected during 2012\u20132014. Conventional morphology and rep-PCR were performed in our Mycology Laboratory. The identification, evaluation, and reporting of strains using MALDI-TOF-MS were performed by BioM\u00e9rieux Diagnostic, Inc. in Istanbul. DNA sequence analysis of the clinical isolates was performed by the BMLabosis laboratory in Ankara. Results: Samples consisted of 18 (75%) lower respiratory tract specimens, 3 otomycosis (12.5%) ear tissues, 1 sample from keratitis, and 1 sample from a cutaneous wound. According to DNA sequence analysis, 12 (50%) specimens were identified as A. fumigatus, 8 (33.3%) as A. flavus, 3 (12.5%) as A. niger, and 1 (4.2%) as A. terreus. Statistically, there was good agreement between the conventional morphology and rep-PCR and MALDI-TOF methods; kappa values were \u03ba = 0.869, 0.871, and 0.916, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The good level of agreement between the methods included in the present study and sequence method could be due to the identification of Aspergillus strains that were commonly encountered. Therefore, it was concluded that studies conducted with a higher number of isolates, which include other Aspergillus strains, are required. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

B. fulva was inoculated on solidified apple juice at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 \u00b0C. Linear-with-breakpoint, Baranyi and Roberts, and Huang primary models (without upper asymptote) were fitted to the data, and they showed good ability to describe the growth kinetics. B. fulva showed longer adaptation time on apple juice than on culture medium, but growth rates were similar as reported in the literature. The dependence of \u03bcmax and \u03bb parameters on temperature was described with Square Root and Arrhenius-Davey secondary models, respectively. These models were important to establish process/storage conditions and apple juice shelf life."

Identification of Pneumocystis in tissue samples is considered difficult and there are only scarce data on its occurrence in European pigs. This investigation presents an in situ hybridization (ISH) procedure for identification of Pneumocystis spp. in paraffin wax embedded tissue samples and its application for labeling the agent in lung samples of pigs with interstitial pneumonia. Thirty-two out of 100 lung samples from pigs on Austrian farms were identified as positive, five of them with multiple, 12 with moderate and 15 with few organisms but Grocott's methenamine silver staining demonstrated that only 20 cases were unequivocally positive for Pneumocystis carinii. In addition to interstitial pneumonia Pneumocystis-positive pigs were more frequently affected with granulomatous pneumonia than Pneumocystis-negative pigs. Frequently concurrent infections with different viral or bacterial lung pathogens were noted but there was no positive correlation between Pneumocystis- and PCV-2-infections. With other infections, no clear-cut differences between Pneumocystis-positive and Pneumocystis-negative animals were found. This study shows that Pneumocystis infections occur frequently in Austrian pigs with interstitial pneumonia. It remains to be shown which are the factors triggering severe multiplication and whether infection with Pneumocystis alone is able to induce lung disease in pigs. \u00a9 The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology 2013."

We studied 85 isolates recovered in Brazil to verify their identification and evaluate their in vitro antifungal susceptibility patterns. Based on phenotypic tests (microscopic features, ability to grow at 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, colony diameters, as well as assimilation of sucrose and raffinose) and molecular assays (amplification of a fragment of the calmodulin gene), the strains were identified as S. schenckii, S. brasiliensis and S. globosa, with a predominance of S. schenckii isolates. There was 37.7% disagreement between the phenotypic and genotypic identification methodologies. In general, terbinafine was the most active drug, followed by ketoconazole and itraconazole, and the less active fluconazole and voriconazole. Five isolates (one S. globosa and four S. schenckii) were found to be itraconazole-resistant strains but, in general, there were no differences in the in vitro antifungal susceptibility profiles among the Sporothrix species. \u00a9 2013 The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology.

            "text": "Melanins are high molecular weight hydrophobic pigments that have been studied for their role in the virulence of fungal pathogens. We investigated the amount and type of melanin in 20 isolates of Aspergillus spp.; A. niger (n = 3), A. flavus (n = 5), A. tamarii (n = 3), A. terreus (n = 3), A. tubingensis (n = 3), A. sydowii (n = 3). Aspergillus spp. were identified by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Extraction of melanin from culture filtrate and fungal biomass was done and followed by qualitative and quantitative analysis of melanin pigment. Ultraviolet (UV), Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra analyses confirmed the presence of melanin. The melanin pathway was studied by analyzing the effects of inhibitors; kojic acid, tropolone, phthalide, and tricyclazole. The results indicate that in A. niger and A. tubingensis melanin was found in both culture filtrate and fungal biomass. For A. tamarii and A. flavus melanin was extracted from biomass only, whereas melanin was found only in culture filtrate for A. terreus. A negligible amount of melanin was found in A. sydowii. The maximum amount of melanin from culture filtrate and fungal biomass was found in A. niger and A. tamarrii, respectively. The DOPA (3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine) pathway produces melanin in A. niger, A. tamarii and A. flavus, whereas the DHN (1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene) pathway produces melanin in A. tubingensis and A. terreus. It can be concluded that the amount and type of melanin in aspergilli largely differ from species to species. \u00a9 2013 The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology.

A total of 24 species of fungal endophytes were identified using molecular approaches. Additionally, the diversity of these endophytic fungi was compared between MCG and FCG. The major isolated endophytes were Edenia gomezpompae and Gibberella moniliformis in the MCG and FCG samples, respectively. The results suggest that ginseng endophytes have different community structures in different environments, and this understanding may prove useful in ginseng cultivation. \u00a9 The Korean Society of Mycology."

In this study, we applied SCAR markers for the rapid and accurate detection of Phytophthora katsurae, the casual agent of chestnut ink disease in Korea. In this study, we developed seven SCAR markers specific to P. katsurae using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and assessed the potential of the SCAR markers to serve as tools for identifying P. katsurae. Seven primer pairs (SOPC 1F/SOPC 1R, SOPC 1-1F/SOPC 1-1R, SOPC 3F/SOPC 3R, SOPC 4F/SOPC 4R, SOPC 4F/SOPC 4-1R, SOPD 9F/SOPD 9R, and SOPD 10F/SOPD 10R) from a sequence derived from RAPD fragments were designed for the analysis of the SCAR markers. To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the SCAR markers, the genomic DNA of P. katsurae was serially diluted 10-fold to final concentrations from 1 mg/mL to 1 pg/mL. The limit of detection using the SCAR markers ranged from 100 \u03bcg/mL to 100 ng/mL. To identify the limit for detecting P. katsurae zoospores, each suspension of zoospores was serially diluted 10-fold to final concentrations from 10 \u00d7 105 to 10 \u00d7 101 zoospores/mL, and then extracted. The limit of detection by SCAR markers was approximately 10 \u00d7 101 zoospores/mL. PCR detection with SCAR markers was specific for P. katsurae, and did not produce any P. katsurae-specific PCR amplicons from 16 other Phytophthora species used as controls. This study shows that SCAR markers are a useful tool for the rapid and effective detection of P. katsurae. \u00a9 The Korean Society of Mycology."

In recent reports, expression analysis has focused on the genes SAP1-6, while the expression pattern of SAP7-10 was less well studied. We analyzed the SAP7-SAP10 expression profile of C. albicans under human serum influence that may be elucidated in the course of blood infection in humans and how this in vitro expression profile is associated with hyphal formation. The phenotypes of strains were examined under scanning electron microscopy. Quantitative RT-PCR (2-\u0394\u0394CT) was used to monitor SAP expression of C. albicans wild type cells and mutants lacking SAP9 and/or SAP10. Of the four analyzed SAP genes, only SAP7 was detectably induced in the double mutant and in the wild type strains in the model that mimics bloodstream infections. On the other hand, in the wild types (isolate 83 and CAF2-1), SAP7 was expressed 0.8- or 0.4-fold less than SAP10, respectively. Our findings suggest that Sap7 may respond to the challenge of the human blood environment. Furthermore, the results support the notion that compensatory upregulation of SAP7 and SAP8 in the \u0394sap9/\u0394sap10 mutant occurs in these conditions. SAP7-10 expression was strain-specific. Our findings point to a link between morphogenesis and expression of SAP9 in serum, where these conditions induce both hyphae and SAP9, but temporal gene expression patterns might be controlled by other factors."

These plant species are in decline, and at present little is known about the potentially diverse communities of mycorrhizal fungi associated with them. This study sets out to provide a baseline description of the ECM community associated with Arctostaphylos uva-ursi over seven sub-alpine/alpine sites in the Scottish highlands. Traditional identification and Sanger sequencing of collected fruit bodies, coupled with next-generation sequencing of host plant root material were used to detect and identify ECM taxa. The ECM community was diverse, with 84 taxa identified to genus level. Only 29 of these are species previously recorded in Scotland. Eight species represent new records for Scotland and the remaining 47 taxa have not yet been identified to species level and are likely to include many currently undescribed species. 39% of species belonged to the genus Cortinarius, whilst Sebacina, Inocybe, Tomentella, Leccinum and Russula were also well represented. Community composition was similar to arctic-alpine ECM communities described elsewhere, but is unique within Scotland. The community was particularly dominated by Suillus variegatus, a species considered to be a specialist associate of Pinus spp. Almost one-fifth of species detected were 'specialist' associates of tree species, highlighting the potential capability of A. uva-ursi ECM communities to facilitate upland woodland regeneration in Scotland. This research should draw awareness to a highly diverse, but poorly recorded community, restricted to a rapidly declining habitat in Scotland."

Thus, the present study was conducted to carry out a detailed taxonomic and revisionary study of Hypotrachyna in South Korea. This study was based on specimens deposited in the Korean Lichen Research Institute (KoLRI). Detailed taxonomic studies and a literature review confirmed the presence of seven species of Hypotrachyna from South Korea, including one new record, Hypotrachyna nodakensis (Asahina) Hale. Descriptions of each species with their morphological, anatomical and chemical characters together with a key to all known Hypotrachyna species are presented. \u00a9 The Korean Society of Mycology."

DNA sequence-based methods offer an opportunity for faster, accurate diagnosis and for effective therapy. As our objective of the study, the ability of the Prove-it Sepsis platform, already proven as a rapid PCR- and microarray-based assay for the majority of sepsis-causing bacteria, was extended to also rapidly identify clinically relevant yeasts in blood culture. The performance characteristics of this extended platform are described. We found that the extended diagnostic Prove-it Sepsis platform was found to be highly accurate when analyzing primary isolates, spiked blood cultures, nucleic acid extracts from a retrospective blood culture data set, and primary blood cultures. Comparison of the blood culture results from the Prove-it Sepsis platform with those from conventional culture-based methods or by gene sequencing demonstrated a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 98% for fungal targets (based on analysis of a total of 388 specimens). Total assay time was 3 h from DNA extraction to BSI diagnosis. These results extend the performance characteristics of the Prove-it platform for bacteria to the easy, rapid, and accurate detection and species identification of yeasts in positive blood cultures. Incorporation of this extended and rapid diagnostic platform into the tools for clinical patient management would allow possibly faster identification and more focused therapies for BSIs.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the distribution of Malassezia species in patients with pityriasis versicolor based on morphological, physiological and biochemical criteria in Sari, Iran. Materials and Methods: In total, among 134 patients clinically suspected of having pityriasis versicolor, attending the Department of Mycology, Boali Sina Hospital and Referral Laboratory of the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, 116/134 (86.5%) positive patients for Malassezia elements, namely, yeast cells and short hyphae in microscopic examination, were included in the study. All 116 samples were inoculated on plates containing modified Leeming and Notman agar medium and identified at species level based on mycological criteria. Results: However, only 100/116 (86.2%) or 100/134 (74.6 %) of the patients showed Malassezia spp in culture. Malassezia. globosa (54%) was the most commonly isolated species followed by M. furfur (32%), M. slooffiae (6%), M. restricta (6%) and M. sympodialis (2%). Mixed Malassezia species were not identified. Conclusions: M. globosa was found to be the predominant pityriasis versicolor isolate in Sari, Iran. Since Malassezia species show different responses in their antifungal therapy, thus correct identification of Malassezia species and antifungal susceptibility test could facilitate selection of appropriate antifungal agents. \u00a9 2013, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences; Licensee Kowsar Ltd."

Functional analysis in Candida albicans, a major fungal pathogen, has generally included characterization of mutant strains with insertion or deletion alleles and over-expression alleles. Here we use in C. albicans another type of allele that has been employed effectively in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a \"Decreased Abundance by mRNA Perturbation\" (DAmP) allele (Yan et al., 2008). DAmP alleles are created systematically through replacement of 30 noncoding regions with nonfunctional heterologous sequences, and thus are broadly applicable. We used a DAmP allele to probe the function of Sun41, a surface protein with roles in cell wall integrity, cell-cell adherence, hyphal formation, and biofilm formation that has been suggested as a possible therapeutic target (Firon et al., 2007; Hiller et al., 2007; Norice et al., 2007). A SUN41-DAmP allele results in approximately 10-fold reduced levels of SUN41 RNA, and yields intermediate phenotypes in most assays. We report that a sun41\u0394/\u0394 mutant is defective in biofilm formation in vivo, and that the SUN41-DAmP allele complements that defect. This finding argues that Sun41 may not be an ideal therapeutic target for biofilm inhibition, since a 90% decrease in activity has little effect on biofilm formation in vivo. We anticipate that DAmP alleles of C. albicans genes will be informative for analysis of other prospective drug targets, including essential genes. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc."

As this situation continues to evolve, the clinical microbiology laboratory has few new, innovative methodologies to diagnose these serious infections and existing methods lack sensitivity. This represents a difficult clinical situation for health care providers, as they are left to rely on clinical instincts for the management of patients with potential IFIs, as mycology test results are not consistently reliable. The goals of this session of Camp Clin Micro (CCM) were to critically assess currently available methods and practices for diagnosing IFIs, to discuss the potential of current investigational methods, to evaluate the role of antifungal susceptibility testing, and finally to identify action items that can help move the field of diagnostic mycology in a direction that will improve our ability to identify IFIs in a timely manner. This is meant to be not a comprehensive overview of the diagnosis of IFIs but rather a detailed account of the discussion at CCM among clinical microbiologists with experience in diagnostic mycology and knowledge of the literature.

The results of these investigations showed that the vegetables responded well to the SMC treatment. Each of them attained its best growth and gave the highest number of flowers and fruits when planted on 6 kg of depleted garden soil supplemented with 600 g of SMC. The control experiment that has the seedlings of the vegetables planted on 6 kg of depleted garden soil only, without the application of SMC, showed stunted and poor growth, with few or no flower and fruit production. A. esculentus was the best utilizer of iron utilizing 118.0 mg/kg in the SMC used. Similarly; this vegetable utilized 1.48 mg/kg of nitrogen in the SMC. The highest height in each vegetable was attained with 6 kg of depleted garden soil supplemented with 600 g of SMC. At 9 wk, A. esculentus has the mean height of 85.0 cm while these values significantly increased to 100.00 cm at 14 wk (p \u2264 0.05). At 9 wk, L. esculentum has the highest mean height of 65.00 cm which increased to 71.00 cm after 14 wk. It was also observed that A. esculentus has the highest mean number of fruits (9.00), followed in order by C. chinense (8.00) and L. esculentus (7.00) (p \u2264 0.05) while, C. annum produced the least mean number of fruits (5.00). No fruits production was seen in the control experiments. The results of these findings were discussed in relation to the usage of SMC as possible organic fertilizer for the improvement of growth of vegetables in Nigeria. \u00a9 The Korean Society of Mycology."

The database comprises partial sequences from three nuclear genes: translation elongation factor 1\u03b1 (EF-1\u03b1), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RPB1), and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RPB2). These three gene fragments can be amplified by PCR and sequenced using primers that are conserved across the phylogenetic breadth of Fusarium. Phylogenetic analyses of the combined data set reveal that, with the exception of two monotypic lineages, all clinically relevant fusaria are nested in one of eight variously sized and strongly supported species complexes. The monophyletic lineages have been named informally to facilitate communication of an isolate's clade membership and genetic diversity. To identify isolates to the species included within the database, partial DNA sequence data from one or more of the three genes can be used as a BLAST query against the database which is Web accessible at FUSARIUM-ID (http://isolate.fusariumdb.org) and the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS-KNAW) Fungal Biodiversity Center (http://www.cbs.knaw.nl/fusarium). Alternatively, isolates can be identified via phylogenetic analysis by adding sequences of unknowns to the DNA sequence alignment, which can be downloaded from the two aforementioned websites. The utility of this database should increase significantly as members of the clinical microbiology community deposit in internationally accessible culture collections (e.g., CBS-KNAW or the Fusarium Research Center) cultures of novel mycosis-associated fusaria, along with associated, corrected sequence chromatograms and data, so that the sequence results can be verified and isolates are made available for future study.

This Code has permitted most fungi expressing both sexual and asexual states (i.e., pleomorphic fungi) to be accorded separate name(s) for the asexual states. Prior to 1981, the rules on naming pleomorphic fungi had become complicated and were not being applied consistently by mycologists. The changes made in 1981 simplified procedures but resulted in numerous name changes in Aspergillus. Molecular data in particular can now resolve the phylogenetic position of a fungus regardless of whether it expresses sexual or asexual structures. A growing consensus now wishes to either remove entirely or drastically amend the provision to permit separate names to be used for different states of the same species. Some initial changes towards that eventual goal were made at the 2005 International Botanical Congress, and a Special Committee then appointed is debating the most appropriate action to take. In the interim, in order to minimize confusion, mycologists working with Aspergillus and other affected genera are urged to refrain from both introducing new scientific names for further states of already known species, and also from using any such names proposed. \u00a9 2011 ISHAM."

We conducted a systematic review assessing the diagnostic accuracy of PCR-based methods to detect Candida spp. directly in blood samples. We searched electronic databases for prospective or retrospective cohort and case-control studies. Two reviewers abstracted data independently. Meta-analysis was performed using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Random-effects metaregression was performed to assess the effects of study methods and infection characteristics on sensitivity or specificity values. We included 54 studies with 4,694 patients, 963 of whom had proven/probable or possible IC. Perfect (100%) sensitivity and specificity for PCR in whole-blood samples was observed when patients with cases had candidemia and controls were healthy people. When PCR was performed to evaluate patients with suspected invasive candidiasis, the pooled sensitivity for the diagnosis of candidemia was 0.95 (confidence interval, 0.88 to 0.98) and the pooled specificity was 0.92 (0.88 to 0.95). A specificity of >90% was maintained in several analyses considering different control groups. The use of whole-blood samples, rRNA, or P450 gene targets and a PCR detection limit of \u226410 CFU/ml were associated with improved test performance. PCR positivity rates among patients with proven or probable IC were 85% (78 to 91%), while blood cultures were positive for 38% (29 to 46%). We conclude that direct PCR using blood samples had good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of IC and offers an attractive method for early diagnosis of specific Candida spp. Its effects on clinical outcomes should be investigated.

Fungi cause BWI as part of monomicrobial or polymicrobial infection, fungaemia, rare aggressive soft tissue infection and as opportunistic infections. The risk factors for acquiring fungal infection in burns include age of burns, total burn size, body surface area (BSA) (30-60%), full thickness burns, inhalational injury, prolonged hospital stay, late surgical excision, open dressing, artificial dermis, central venous catheters, antibiotics, steroid treatment, long-term artificial ventilation, fungal wound colonisation (FWC), hyperglycaemic episodes and other immunosuppressive disorders. Most of the fungal infections are missed owing to lack of clinical awareness and similar presentation as bacterial infection coupled with paucity of mycology laboratories. Expedient diagnosis and treatment of these mycoses can be life-saving as the mortality is otherwise very high. Emergence of resistance in non-albicans Candida spp., unusual yeasts and moulds in fungal BWI, leaves very few fungi susceptible to antifungal drugs, leaving many patients susceptible. There is a need to speciate fungi as far as the topical and systemic antifungal is concerned. Deep tissue biopsy and other relevant samples are processed by standard mycological procedures using direct microscopy, culture and histopathological examination. Patients with FWC should be treated by aggressive surgical debridement and, in the case of fungal wound infection (FWI), in addition to surgical debridement, an intravenous antifungal drug, most commonly amphotericin B or caspofungin, is prescribed followed by de-escalating with voriconazole or itraconazole, or fluconazole depending upon the species or antifungal susceptibility, if available. The propensity for fungal infection increases, the longer the wound is present. Therefore, the development of products to close the wound more rapidly, improvement in topical antifungal therapy with mould activity and implementation of appropriate systemic antifungal therapy guided by antifungal susceptibility may improve the outcome for severely injured burn victims."

Direct microscopy by potassium hydroxide and lactophenol cotton blue mounts followed by culture on Sabourad's dextrose agar (SDA) was done. Susceptibility testing was performed by the broth microdilution technique as per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute standards (M-38A). Additionally, all the isolates were also tested by the colorimetric microdilution technique using Alamar Blue dye. Statistical Analysis: It was done by the Chi-square test and Z-test using SPSS statistical software version 12.0. Results and Conclusion: Twenty-seven isolates (47.3%) were recovered from patients with chronic bronchial asthma followed by fibrocavitary pulmonary tuberculosis in 9 (15.7%), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in 6 cases (10.5%), bronchiectasis in 3 (5.2%), bronchogenic carcinoma in 5 (8.7%) and those receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer 7 (12.2%). Thirteen environmental isolates were also included in the study. The most common isolate was A. fumigatus 28 (40%), followed by A. niger 22 (31%), A. flavus 13 (19%), and A. terreus 7(10%). All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, itraconazole, and voriconazole. Among the three agents tested, voriconazole exhibited lowest MICs (1 g/ml) against all Aspergillus species."

A simple microplate-based method to assay \u03b2-1,3-glucanase activity is described here as an alternative to an expensive tube-assay method. The reaction volume of the micro-assay was reduced to 130 \u03bcl from the 1150 \u03bcl used in the standard \u03b2-1,3-glucanase macro-assay. Statistical analyses showed significant difference in sensitivity between the micro- and the macro-assay. The micro-method was optimized using the Response Surface Quadratic Model. The sensitivity of the optimized micro-method was shown to be four-fold greater than the macro-assay and two-fold higher than the micro-assay. The optimized micro-assay was significantly more sensitive in all of the twenty examined isolates during Trichoderma spp. \u03b2-1,3-glucanase screening. We conclude that this modified and optimized method is more convenient, faster, cheaper and more reproducible than the traditional tube-assay. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Methods: A retrospective review of 25 cases diagnosed with Pcm and cancer, retrieved from a series of 808 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with Pcm based on tests conducted in the Mycology Laboratory of the Santa Casa Complexo Hospitalar, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, between 1972 and 2007. The diagnosis of Pcm was confirmed by means of direct microscopic examination, histopathological examination or immunodiffusion test. All cancer cases were confirmed by histopathological or cytopathological examination. Results: Respiratory symptoms were the principal complaints of the patients evaluated. Pulmonary involvement predominated, followed by skin and lymph node involvement. The most prevalent tumor was bronchial carcinoma, in 15 patients, followed by other types of carcinoma, and 1 patient had Hodgkin's lymphoma. In 16 patients (64%), the site of the Pcm was the same as that of the tumor. In most cases, Pcm treatment consisted of the isolated administration of sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ketoconazole, itraconazole or amphotericin B. The most common treatment for cancer was surgery, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Of the 25 patients, 12 were cured of Pcm, and 4 died. In 9 patients, the final outcome was unknown. In the general population of the area under study, the prevalence of lung cancer was significantly higher in smokers with Pcm than in smokers without Pcm (p < 0.001). Conclusions: A diagnosis of Pcm appears to increase the risk of lung cancer."

There is a growing interest in predictive modeling microbial growth as an alternative to time consuming traditional, microbiological enumeration techniques. Several statistical models have been accounted to describe the growth of different micro-organisms. However neural networks, as highly nonlinear approximator scheme, have the potential of modeling some complex, phenomena better than the others. The application of adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems in predictive microbiology is presented in this paper. This technique is used to build up a model of the joint effect of wateractivity, pH level and temperature to predict the maximum specific growth rate of the Ascomycetous Fungus Monascus Ruber. The proposed scheme is compared against standard neural network approaches. Neuro-fuzzy systems offer an alternative and powerful technique to model microbial kinetic parameters and could thus become an efficient tool in predictive mycology. \u00a9 2009 IEEE."

            "text": "Background: Cutaneous fungal infections are common in Tehran, Iran, and causative organisms include dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte molds. The prevalence of superficial mycosis infections has risen to such a level that skin mycoses now affect more than 20-25% of the world's population, making them the most frequent form of infection. Aims: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of superficial cutaneous fungal infections especially dermatophytosis in our Medical Mycology Laboratory in the Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran. Methods: A total of 17,573 specimens were collected from clinically suspected tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea capitis, tinea faciei, tinea pedis, tinea manuum and finger and toe onychomycosis from 2000 to 2005. Patients were referred to our laboratory for direct examination, fungal culture and identification. The incidence of each species was thus calculated. Results: Dermatophytes remain the most commonly isolated fungal organisms, except from clinically suspected finger onychomycosis, in which case Candida species comprise >7% of the isolates. Epidermophyton floccosum remains the most prevalent fungal pathogen and increased incidence of this species was observed in tinea cruris. Trichophyton tonsurans continues to increase in incidence. Conclusion: This study identifies the epidemiologic trends and the predominant organisms causing dermatophytosis in Tehran, Iran. These data can be used to ascertain the past and present trends in incidence, predict the adequacy of our current pharmacologic repertoire and provide insight into future developments. Consideration of the current epidemiologic trends in the incidence of cutaneous fungal pathogens is of key importance to investigational effort, diagnosis and treatment."

Environmental factors such as temperature, water activity and pH have a great influence on fungal development. In this study, a strain of P. glabrum referenced to as LCP 08.5568, has been isolated from a bottle of aromatised mineral water. The effects of temperature, aw and pH on radial growth rate were assessed on Czapeck Yeast Agar (CYA) medium. Models derived from the cardinal model with inflection [Rosso et al., 1993 An unexpected correlation between cardinal temperatures of microbial growth highlighted by a new model. J. Theor. Bio. 162, 447-463.] were used to fit the experimental data and determine for each factor, the cardinal parameters (minimum, optimum and maximum). Precise characterisation of the growth conditions for such a fungal contaminant, has an evident interest to understand and to prevent spoilage of food products. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Aspergillus species are ubiquitous in nature, have no geographic predilection, and the spectrum of disease they cause is myriad, ranging from noninvasive disease with colonization to disseminated disease with an associated high mortality rate. The extent of disease is thus largely responsible for both the choice and the duration of antifungal therapy. Recent years have seen an expansion of antifungal agents, with efficacy against Aspergillus requiring an understanding of the full spectrum of disease for them to be used appropriately.

However, the species involved and the resulting clinical entities vary both geographically and with time. We have surveyed 15,333 dermatophytes obtained from primary isolations at the Mycology Reference Laboratory, Bristol, UK from 1980 through 2005. Several striking trends in dermatophyte prevalence were apparent over this period. The relative frequencies of isolations of Microsporum canis (cat and dog ringworm), Trichophyton verrucosum (cattle ringworm), T. mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes (rodent ringworm) and Epidermophyton floccosum (a cause of human groin and foot infections) all decreased by 90%. Conversely, the contributions of T. tonsurans and T. violaceum (two anthropophilic scalp-infecting species) to total dermatophyte isolations increased by 1000% over the same period. Finally, T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale, the two common causes of foot infection comprised 80% of all dermatophytes isolated in 1980 and 90% of isolations in 2005. Similar trends in dermatophyte prevalence were evidenced throughout the British Isles, based on the voluntary reporting of isolations from a large number of British laboratories at 5-yearly intervals over the same period. The implications of these changing patterns of dermatophyte species, and the clinical entities they produce are discussed in the context of a review of worldwide dermatophyte isolations over the last three decades, with emphasis on the causal agents of tinea capitis."

Design - Retrospective case series. Sample Population-1,772 clinical samples of various types obtained from dogs examined at the University of Tennessee Veterinary Teaching Hospital or at regional veterinary hospitals and submitted to the bacteriology and mycology laboratories associated with the teaching hospital. Procedures - Samples were submitted by attending veterinarians to the bacteriology and mycology laboratories for routine aerobic microbial culture. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility procedures were performed on all isolates. Susceptibility reports for each antimicrobial and Staphylococcus spp were determined from aggregate electronically archived test results. Oxacillin and multidrug resistance for Staphylococcus intermedius was analyzed by reviewing disk diffusion zone measurements. Results - Oxacillin resistance increased among S intermedius isolates during the past 5 years, and the increase was associated with multidrug resistance. In 2005, 1 in 5 Staphylococcus spp isolates from canine clinical samples was resistant to oxacillin. The most common staphylococcal species isolated were S intermedius (n = 37), Staphylococcus schleiferi (21), and Staphylococcus aureus (4), and frequencies of oxacillin resistance in isolates of these species were 15.6%, 46.6%, and 23.5%, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Veterinarians should be aware of the potential for empiric drug treatment failures in instances where Staphylococcus spp infections are common (eg, pyoderma). Judicious use of bacterial culture and susceptibility testing is recommended."

Favorable correlation with the M27-A2 method was not seen for isolates of C. albicans, C. tropicalis or other Candida spp., particularly their trailing-growth isolates. However, the degree of correlation and agreement of MIC values were markedly improved when testing was performed by the modified JSMM method in which the end-point to be read was changed from IC80 (for the current JSMM method) to IC50. These results suggest that there is an urgent need to revise the current JSMM method."

Target sequences in the noncoding internal transcribed spacer regions of the rRNA operon were simultaneously amplified and interrogated with fluorescent probes to identify Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, and C. lusitaniae; these account for 88% of the yeast species isolated from positive blood cultures in our laboratory. Any of the first four species can be identified in a single reaction using two fluorescent hybridization probe sets. The antifungal-resistant species C. krusei and C. lusitaniae are detected in a second reaction, also with two probe sets. The assay was validated with DNA extracted from BACTEC blood culture bottles positive for yeasts (n = 62) and was 100% concordant with culture identification based on biochemical and morphological features of C. albicans (n = 22), C. parapsilosis (n = 10), C. tropicalis (n = 1) C. glabrata (n = 22), C. krusei (n = 2), and C. lusitaniae (n = 1). No cross-reactivity was observed in blood culture samples growing yeasts other than the above-mentioned species (n = 4), in those growing bacteria (n = 12), or in the absence of microbial growth. Our assay allows rapid \u22642 h) and specific detection of the most common Candida spp. directly from positive blood cultures and may facilitate delivery of optimal antifungal therapy."

This study was undertaken to obtain more information about the microbiological properties of this product and particularly about the presence, metabolic activities, and technological significance of the different yeast species naturally occurring in Manteca. High numbers of yeasts were counted after 7 days ripening (10                             4                             -10                             5                              cfu g                             -1                             ) and then decreased to 10                             2                              at the end. A total of 179 isolates were identified and studied for their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. The most frequently encountered species were Trichosporon asahii (45), Candida parapsilosis (33), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (32), Candida inconspicua (29). Some of these yeasts showed lipolytic activity (32 strains) and proteolytic activity (29 strains), NaCl resistance up to 10% and growth up to 45\u00b0C (42 strains). Biogenic amines were formed by proteolytic strains, in particular phenylethylamine, putrescine and spermidine. Spermidine was produced by all the yeasts tested in this work, but only Trichosporon produced a great quantity of this compound. Histamine was not detectable. Caseinolytic activity was common to almost all strains, corresponding to the ability to efficiently split off amino-terminal amino acids. The highest and most constant activity expressed by all species was X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase. The findings suggest that the presence of yeasts may play a significant role in justifying interactions with lactic acid bacteria, and consequently with their metabolic activity in the definition of the peculiar characteristics of Manteca cheese. \u00a9 2002 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Methods - 761 microbiological analyses of storage media (Inosol and Exosol, Opsia, Toulouse, France), sampled in all phases of the organ culture at 31\u00b0C of 410 consecutive corneas, were analysed. Each medium was inoculated in a pair of Bactec Plus Aerobic/F and Bactec Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F blood bottles and placed in a Bactec 9240 incubator for 14 days at 37\u00b0C and in a Sabouraud broth at 20\u00b0C. Changes in colour or turbidity of storage media were evaluated daily at the corneal bank. Recipients were screened post-graft for infectious signs. Results - Overall contamination rate was 2.4% (18/761). Contamination was detected in less than 1 day in 78% (14/18) and less than 2 days in 94% (17/18). Positivity of the microbiological controls of starting media preceded changes medium colour in 10 out of 14 cases. Bactec blood bottles allowed detection of bacteria as well as yeasts. Conclusion - The use of a pair of Bactec blood culture bottles appears reliable for the rapid diagnosis of a wide range of microbiological contaminations of organ cultured corneas during banking."

These antibodies in the sera from all patients with those types of aspergillosis were thus detected significantly more clearly than in the healthy, normal controls. Double diffusion tests using the same antigens were also performed to compare the efficacy of these two methods. In several cases showing negative in the double diffusion test, these antibodies were found to react with proteins possessing the molecular weight of 20, 35, 50, 65 and 73kDa, while in other cases showing positive in the double diffusion test, the antibodies could not be distinguished from each other. We therefore used the Western blotting method to distinguish them. From the data obtained it was concluded that serologic diagnosis by the detection of IgM and IgG using the immunoblot method plays an important role in strengthening the clinical diagnosis. \u00a9 1995, The Japanese Society for Medical Mycology.

Sex ratio (male/female) was 1.5:1, and the largest population was individuals in their 4th decade. Among 5, 580 cases of dermatophytoses, tinea pedis was the most frequent (64.0%), followed by teinea unguium (14.2%), tinea cruris (10.4%), tinea corporis (8.2%), tinea manuum (2.8%), tinea capitis (0.3%), kerion celsi (2 cases) and tinea barbae (1 case). The incidence of tinea pedis increased, whereas that of tinea cruris and tinea corporis decreased during the 10 year survey. Thirty point seven % of dermatophytosis cases had two or more clinical types; for example, 81.4% of tinea unguium and 69.2% of tinea manuum cases had concomitant tinea pedis, respectively. 3,669 dermatophyte fungi were isolated during the survey. They were Trichophyton rubrum (TR) (67.8%), T. mentagrophytes (TM) (26.5%), Microsporum canis (MC) (3.9%), Epidermophyton floccosum (1.6%), M. gypseum (0.1%) and T. violaceum (0.1%). Sixty three point five % of the dermatophytes isolated from tinea pedis was TR. Among the 144 MC isolated, 120 were from tinea corporis, 15 from tinea capitis, 8 from tinea pedis and 1 was from tinea manuum. TR was 2.6 times more frequent than TM. This ratio is higher than that of previous reports from Hokkaido prefecture, Japan. \u00a9 1994, The Japanese Society for Medical Mycology. All rights reserved."

This finding in the flitter mouse dung was the first recorded in Japan. Twenty-six samples of the above substrates were also examined for their mycoflora. To determine the best method for routine clinical examination for C. neoformans, various identification techniques were compared morphologically and physiologically, using 10 isolates from the clinical sources and 249 from the pigeon droppings. The phenol oxidase reaction may serve as a simplified identification method of C. neoformans. The physiological characteristics were tested for the effects of temperature and pH concentration on their growth. The tested isolates grew within the range of 6-37\u00b0C, the optimum temperature for growth being 25\u00b0C. No growth was observed at 43.5\u00b0C. Heat treatment at 50\u00b0C for 5min effectively sterilized the cell suspensions. Measurements of the tolerance of the isolates for UV irradiation and common disinfectants showed that all isolates were strongly resistant to UV irradiation. With the exception of 0.02-0.5% chlorohexidine gluconate, common disinfectants were found to be effective in vitro for the sterilization of the isolates. \u00a9 1994, The Japanese Society for Medical Mycology.

Evaluations were made by culturing fungi on small square pieces of Christensen's urea agar, 0.05% yeast extract agar with human hair, Sabouraud dextrose agar, oatmeal agar and oatmeal with 1% dextrose agar medium. The urease test was negative in 71.2% of the isolates of T. rubrum, indeterminate in 27.2% and positive in 1.4% and was negative in 4.3% of T. mentagrophytes, indeterminate in 19.4% and positive in 76.3%. In vitro hair perforation test was negative in 97.9% and positive in 2.1% of T. rubrum, and was negative in 20.4% and positive in 79.6% of T. mentagrophytes. Red pigment production test was positive in 24% of T. rubrum, while it was negative in all of the isolates of T. mentagrophytes. All isolates that showed negative or indeterminate in the urease test and negative in the in vitro hair perforation test were T. rubrum. And all those that showed positive in the urease and in vitro hair perforation tests were T. mentagrophytes. The combination of urease test and in vitro hair perforation test seems very useful to distinguish T. rubrum from T. mentagrophytes. The high rate (76.3%) of clear distinction of these two fungi achieved by this combination indicates the reliability of the culture method for identification of dermatophytes. \u00a9 1993, The Japanese Society for Medical Mycology.

A significant (P < 0.01) correlation exists between fungal growth and FB1 (r = 0.89) and FB2 (r = 0.87) production in corn patties, beginning after 2 days and reaching the stationary phase after 14 days of incubation. [14C]FB1 was produced by adding L-[methyl-14C]methionine daily to cultures during the logarithmic phase of production. Incorporation of the isotope occurred at C-21 and C-22 of the fumonisin molecule and was enhanced in the presence of unlabeled L- methionine. Although the concentration of exogenous unlabeled methionine is critical for incorporation of the 14C label, optimum incorporation was achieved by adding 50 mg of unlabeled L-methionine and 200 \u03bcCi of L-[methyl- 14C]methionine to a corn patty (30 g) over a period of 9 days, yielding [14C]FB1 with a specific activity of 36 \u03bcCi/mmol."

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for TN, SA and their combination were determined here using ten strains among five species of dermatophytes. The therapeutic effect of ZM-589 on experimental cutaneous Trichophyton mentagrophytes infection in guinea pigs was compared with ZM-SA (ZM-589 without SA), ZM-TN (ZM-589 without TN) and three commercial products: 1% Miconazol nitrate solution, 1% Ciclopirox olamine solution and 5% Exalamide solution (containing 2% Salicylic acid). MICs of TN and SA were 0.06-0.2 and around 1250\u03bcg/ml, respectively. MIC of the combination of TN and SA was essentially the same as that of TN alone. In a comparative study on experimental dermatophytosis on guinea pig skin, ZM-589 was statistically superior to any preparation used in the study including ZM-SA. The results were also supported by data on the negative rate of culture. These results suggest that ZM-589 can be beneficial in the clinical treatment of patients with dermatophytosis. \u00a9 1993, The Japanese Society for Medical Mycology. All rights reserved."

            "text": "Serum mannan-binding protein (MBP) is a calcium dependent lectin specific for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine and was first isolated by our group from rabbits and subsequently from human and rats. Analysis of the human serum-MBP and its cDNA clones reveals that the protein is divided into four domains: a cyctein-rich NH2-terminal domain that cross-link the subunits each other, the second collagen like domain which consisted of twenty repeats of a Gly-X-Y sequence, and a third neck domain located between the second collagen like domain and a fourth COOH-terminal carbohydraterecognition domain, the sequence homology of which is markedly high among calcium dependent mammalian lectins. The lectin has an apparent molecular mass of 600,000 daltons consisting of multimers of a single subunit of around 31,000 daltons. MBP has a role in host defense; this is suggested first by our finding that the lectin can activate the complement system through the classical pathway, and by the demonstration by Ezekowitz's group that the lectin inhibits in vitro infection by the human immunodeficiency virus and stimulates phagocytosis of bacterium with mannose residues on their surfaces by neutrophiles and macrophages. The physiological importance of MBP is confirmed by the finding that low serum MBP concentrations are associated with a common opsonic defect, which is found in 5~7% of the general population. \u00a9 1992, The Japanese Society for Medical Mycology.

Each clinical isolate was cultured on 5 small square pieces of different media in a plastic tissue culture flask. Sabouraud dextrose agar, Christensen's urea agar, 0.05% yeast extract agar with human hair, oatmeal agar and oatmeal with 1% dextrose agar medium were used. This method was useful for microscopic observation of fungi without the slide culture technique, for urease test, and for in vitro hair perforation test with solid medium. At the outpatient dermatology clinic in the Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, 488 lesions of tinea were cultured on Sabouraud cycloheximide chloramphenicol agar and isolates were identified with the present new culture method. The fungi were 396 isolates of dermatophytes, 11 isolates of contaminating molds and 7 isolates of yeasts. The dermatophytes identified were 231 isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, 156 isolates of T. mentagrophytes, 2 isolates of T. tonsurans, 3 isolates of Epidermophyton floccosum and 1 isolate of Microsporum canis. Only 3 isolates of dermatophytes could not be identified. The high rate of identification (99.2%) achieved may speak highly for this easy and reliable culture method to identify dermatophytes. \u00a9 1993, The Japanese Society for Medical Mycology.

Sinusitis caused by Drechslera spicifera, a common saprophytic dematiacious fungus, has previously been reported in only three immunocompetent patients. Aggressive growth characteristics were not described in any of these reports. The case of a young immunocompetent pregnant woman with fulminant sinusitis caused by Drechslera spicifera is presented. The tumor, which invaded both orbits and the anterior cranial fossa, was rapidly progressive during pregnancy. After delivery of the baby, a combined craniofacial approach was used to excise the sinus mass while adjacent normal tissues were preserved. The pathophysiology and mycology of this uncommon sinus pathogen are reviewed. This case emphasizes the need for prompt surgical intervention to avoid potentially life-threatening complications from a fulminant mycotic process in the paranasal sinuses. Indications for postoperative chemotherapy with amphotericin B are discussed. \u00a9 The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc."

The main emphasis of the scheme has been on the support of simulated clinical material for proficiency testing. Of 494 laboratories currently participating in the scheme, 84 are abroad and over 500 specimens have been distributed between 1974 and 1980. A wide variety of specimens are issued. These include specimens for: general bacteriology including isolation, sensitivity testing and serology; mycobacterial bacteriology; syphilis serology; virus isolation; general viral serology; rubella serology; hepatitis B antigen detection; electron microscopy; mycology; parasitology; antibiotic assay; public health specimens including milk and water. Laboratories are requested to examine the specimens using their routine procedures and report their results to the Microbiological Quality Control Laboratory (MQCL). The reports are analysed at MQCL and the summarised results of each distribution are sent to participants. Each participant receives details of his individual performance on current specimens and an analysis of the previous 6 months, cumulative performance. The performance of all laboratories is reviewed twice yearly and laboratories with results significantly worse than those of their peers are offered the opportunity to seek advice and help from a National Advisory Panel of their professional colleagues. The scheme is confidential and its main role is educational."
