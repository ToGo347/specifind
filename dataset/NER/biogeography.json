            "text": "In Brazil, the state of Tocantins, located in north-central Brazil, has experienced a significant number of cases of arboviral disease, particularly Dengue virus (DENV). This study aimed to deepen the knowledge on DENV circulation within that state by conducting full genome sequencing of viral genomes recovered from 61 patients between June 2021 and July 2022. There were a total of 8807 and 20,692 cases in 2021 and 2022, respectively, as reported by the state\u2019s Secretary of Health. Nucleotide sequencing confirmed the circulation of DENV serotype 1, genotype V and DENV serotype 2, genotype III in the State. Younger age groups (4 to 43 years old) were mostly affected; however, no significant differences were detected regarding the gender distribution of cases in humans. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the circulating viruses belong to DENV-1 genotype V American and DENV-2 genotype III Southeast Asian/American. The Bayesian analysis of DENV-1 genotype V genomes sequenced here are closely related to genomes previously sequenced in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Regarding the DENV-2 genotype III genomes, these clustered in a distinct, well-supported subclade, along with previously reported isolates from the states of Goi\u00e1s and S\u00e3o Paulo. The findings reported here suggest that multiple introductions of these genotypes occurred in the Tocantins state. This observation highlights the importance of major population centers in Brazil on virus dispersion, such as those observed in other Latin American and North American countries. In the SNP analysis, DENV-1 displayed 122 distinct missense mutations, while DENV-2 had 44, with significant mutations predominantly occurring in the envelope and NS5 proteins. The analyses performed here highlight the concomitant circulation of distinct DENV-1 and -2 genotypes in some Brazilian states, underscoring the dynamic evolution of DENV and the relevance of surveillance efforts in supporting public health policies. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Global Ecology and Biogeography. 2023; 32(7): 1189\u20131204. In the original version of the published article, we made a mistake in the species-level predictions of population density (Appendix\u00a0S2). The mistake originated from taking the mean of log10 predicted values, rather than taking the mean of values in natural scale. This resulted in an underestimate of predicted population densities by 35% on average. This mistake also influenced Figures\u00a04, S7 and S8, which were based on species-level predictions, as well as a few examples of predicted densities in the result and discussion sections. 4 FIGURE (Figure presented.) Population density predictions for 9089 bird species. (a) Showing population density predictions displayed on the bird phylogeny to highlight phylogenetic clustering. (b) Violin plot showing the distribution of density predictions per order, and average estimates per species used to train the model on top displayed as dots. We have corrected the error and generated all the predictions again. We revised Appendix\u00a0S2 with the corrected estimates and added the mean of the field estimates and their sample size as reference values, as well as a more informative legend and description of all fields. Furthermore, we have generated the revised Figures\u00a04, S7 and S8 and adjusted the main text accordingly. The differences in the patterns are minimal and do not influence any of our original conclusions. We apologize for this error. \u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

In light of the massive recent increase in the availability of online occurrence data, we highlight the strengths and limitations of the mapping methods most widely used to display the geographic distribution of plants, namely geographic range maps and occurrence record maps. We use the modern distribution of the genus Arbutus in western Eurasia, North Africa, and Macaronesia, for which no occurrence record map has been published yet, to discuss critical issues in data collection and representation. The occurrence record map of A. unedo, A. andrachne, A. canariensis, and A. pavarii shows how well this mapping method captures the details of peripheral and isolated stands as well as the variability of population density. A number of biogeographical issues are addressed by this approach, including the determination of the chorological centre of gravity in relation to historical dynamics, genetic patterns in relation to range porosity, and the autochthony status of marginal stands. These issues constitute the necessary foundation for additional palaeobotanical research and ecological modelling to investigate the past-to-future dynamics of Arbutus and other species of the Mediterranean\u2013Atlantic area. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

            "text": "The Neotropics contain one of the most diverse assemblages of freshwater fishes worldwide. Part of this diversity is shared between the Orinoco and Amazon basins. These basins have been separated for a long time due to the Vaupes Arch, rising between 10\u201311 Ma. Today, there is only one permanent connection between the Orinoco and Negro (Amazon) basins, known as the Casiquiare Canal. However, alternative corridors allowing fish dispersion between both basins have been proposed. The cardinal tetra (Paracheirodon axelrodi), the most important fish in the ornamental world market, is distributed in both basins. Here we investigated P. axelrodi phylogeography, population structure, and potential routes of migration and connectivity between the two basins. A total of 468 bp of the mitochondrial gene (COI), 555 bp of the nuclear gene fragment (MYH6), and eight microsatellite loci were analyzed. As a result, we found two major genetic clusters as the most likely scenario (K = 2), but they were not discreetly distributed between basins. A gradient of genetic admixture was observed in Cucui and S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira, between the upper Negro River and the upper Orinoco. Samples from the middle-lower Negro River were highly structured. Cucui (Negro basin) was more similar to the Orinoco than to the rest of the Negro basin populations. However, substructure was also observed by the discriminant analysis, fixation indices and other hierarchichal structure analyses (K = 3\u22126), showing three major geographic clusters: Orinoco, Cucui, and the remaining Negro basin. Unidirectional migration patterns were detected between basins: via Cucui toward Orinoco and via the remaining of the Negro basin toward Orinoco. Results from the Relaxed Random Walk analysis support a very recent origin of this species in the headwater Orinoco basin (Western Guiana Shield, at late Pleistocene) with a later rapid colonization of the remaining Orinoco basin and almost simultaneously the Negro River via Cucui, between 0.115 until about 0.001 Ma. Historical biogeography and population genetic patterns observed here for Cardinal tetra, seem to be better explained by river capture, physical, or ecological barriers than due to the geographic distance.

            "text": "Aim: Biodiversity hotspots in wide-ranging marine species typically overlap with regions of high productivity, which are often associated with nutrient-rich waters. Here we investigate how element concentrations in feathers vary among highly mobile seabirds in global seabird biodiversity hotspots. Location: Southern Hemisphere. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Fifteen species in the order Procellariiformes. Methods: We collected data on the concentration of 15 elements in feathers for 253 seabirds sampled across Australia and New Zealand and compared the \u201cfingerprint\u201d of micronutrient element profiles to feathers of related seabirds from global hotspots using principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis and permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Results: Breast feather concentrations of some elements, including aluminium, iron, cobalt, chromium, manganese, nickel, arsenic and cadmium, were tens-to-hundred-fold higher in smaller (<400 g) than larger species (\u2265400 g). We suggest these results reflect the dominance of pelagic crustaceans in the diet of smaller seabirds, blooms of which are influenced by input of limiting ocean nutrients. Cluster analysis revealed three broad groups of feather elements: large seabirds, and small seabirds in each of the South Pacific and South Atlantic Ocean basins. High concentrations of some elements in feathers match seawater availability and are detectable in lower-trophic feeding seabirds with local movements. Conversely, the element fingerprints of longer-distance, higher-trophic foragers, including albatrosses, do not match availability in seawater at the collection site. Main conclusions: The feather element concentrations of shorter-range foraging, lower-trophic feeding seabirds vary significantly among ocean basins, reflecting availability in seawater, while longer-range, higher-trophic species do not. We propose that geographically diverse availability of micronutrients, in addition to primary productivity, may play an underrecognized role in seabird biogeography and intra-hemispheric migration, though more research is needed. This study has important implications, considering the role of element availability in supporting biodiversity hotspots for dispersive marine predators and for the designation of protected areas. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

            "text": "Mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) entering the riverine environment is concerning, given that most plastic pollution never reaches the oceans, and it has a severe negative impact on terrestrial ecosystems. However, significant knowledge gaps on the storage and remobilization of MPW within different rivers over varying timescales remain. Here we analyze the exposure of river systems to MPW to better understand the sedimentary processes that control the legacy of plastic waste. Using a conservative approach, we estimate 0.8 million tonnes of MPW enter rivers annually in 2015, affecting an estimated 84 % of rivers by surface area, globally. By 2060, the amount of MPW input to rivers is expected to increase nearly 3-fold, however improved plastic waste strategies through better governance can decrease plastic pollution by up to 72 %. Currently, most plastic input occurs along anthropogenically modified rivers (49 %) yet these represent only 23 % of rivers by surface area. Another 17 % of MPW occur in free-flowing actively migrating meandering rivers that likely retain most plastic waste within sedimentary deposits, increasing retention times and likelihood of biochemical weathering. Active braided rivers receive less MPW (14 %), but higher water discharge will also increase fragmentation to form microplastics. Only 20 % of plastic pollution is found in non-migrating and free-flowing rivers; these have the highest probability of plastics remaining within the water column and being transferred downstream. This study demonstrates the spatial variability in MPW affecting different global river systems with different retention, fragmentation, and biochemical weathering rates of plastics. Targeted mitigation strategies and environmental risk assessments are needed at both international and national levels that consider river system dynamics. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

In this study, we reconstruct the phylogeny of this section with a complete sampling using a phylogenomic approach. The genome skimming method was applied to obtain the complete plastome sequence, the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA), and the nuclear SNPs data for phylogenetic reconstruction. Using a Bayesian molecular clock approach and ancestral range reconstruction, we reconstruct biogeographical history and discuss the biotic and abiotic factors that may have shaped the distribution patterns of the section. Both nuclear datasets better resolved the phylogeny of the sect. Tubulosae than the plastome sequence. Sect. Tubulosae was resolved as a monophyletic group sister to a clade mainly containing species from the sect. Clematis and sect. Aspidanthera. Within sect. Tubulosae, two major clades were resolved by both nuclear datasets. Two continental taxa, C. heracleifolia and C. tubulosa var. ichangensis, formed one clade. One continental taxon, C. tubulosa, and all the other species from Taiwan island, the Korean peninsula, and the Japanese archipelago formed the other clade. Molecular dating results showed that sect. Tubulosae diverged from its sister clade in the Pliocene, and all the current species diversified during the Pleistocene. Our biogeographical reconstruction suggested that sect. Tubulosae evolved and began species diversification, most likely in mainland China, then dispersed to the Korean peninsula, and then expanded its range through the Japanese archipelago to Taiwan island. Island species diversity may arise through allopatric speciation by vicariance events following the range fragmentation triggered by the climatic oscillation and sea level change during the Pleistocene epoch. Our results highlight the importance of climatic oscillation during the Pleistocene to the spatial-temporal diversification patterns of the sect. Tubulosae. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

            "text": "Tree-kangaroos of the genus Dendrolagus occupy forest habitats of New Guinea and extreme northeastern Australia, but their evolutionary history is poorly known. Descriptions in the 2000s of near-complete Pleistocene skeletons belonging to larger-bodied species in the now-extinct genus Bohra broadened our understanding of morphological variation in the group and have since helped us to identify unassigned fossils in museum collections, as well as to reassign species previously placed in other genera. Here we describe these fossils and analyse tree-kangaroo systematics via comparative osteology. Including B. planei sp. nov., B. bandharr comb. nov. and B. bila comb. nov., we recognise the existence of at least seven late Cenozoic species of Bohra, with a maximum of three in any one assemblage. All tree-kangaroos (Dendrolagina subtribe nov.) exhibit skeletal adaptations reflective of greater joint flexibility and manoeuvrability, particularly in the hindlimb, compared with other macropodids. The Pliocene species of Bohra retained the stepped calcaneocuboid articulation characteristic of ground-dwelling macropodids, but this became smoothed to allow greater hindfoot rotation in the later species of Bohra and in Dendrolagus. Tree-kangaroo diversification may have been tied to the expansion of forest habitats in the early Pliocene. Following the onset of late Pliocene aridity, some tree-kangaroo species took advantage of the consequent spread of more open habitats, becoming among the largest late Cenozoic tree-dwellers on the continent. Arboreal Old World primates and late Quaternary lemurs may be the closest ecological analogues to the species of Bohra. Copyright \u00a9 2023 Magnolia Press."

            "text": "The arrival of Europeans to the Americas triggered a massive exchange of organisms on a continental scale. This exchange was accelerated by the rapid increase in the movement of people and goods during the 20th century. In Chile, scientific and technical literature contains hundreds of records of non-native insect species established in different parts of the territory, from the hyperarid Atacama Desert to the Magallanes Region. Here, we analyse temporal trends, taxonomic diversity, biogeographic origin and main impacts of these species on different sectors in Chile from the European arrival to the present. Our task includes a review of old records in museum catalogues, libraries, collections, expedition records and catalogues. Almost 600 species of non-native insects have been reported to be established in Chile. Introductions started with the very arrival of Europeans to the central valley of Chile and underwent a huge acceleration in the second half of the 20th century. The order Hemiptera was the most prevalent amongst non-native insects. Most species are linked to agriculture and forestry. Species are of Palearctic origin in more than 50% of the records. In terms of temporal trends, the rate of established non-native species shows an abrupt increase at the beginning of the 1950s. This change may be associated with the strong development in agriculture and forestry in Chile after World War II and the increase in intercontinental air traffic. We believe that the understanding of past patterns of introductions is an important component in the design of current policies to minimise the impact of invasive insects. \u00a9 Daniela N.

Solar energy\u2019s drawbacks are weather and environmental dependencies and solar radiation variations. Solar Radiation Forecasting (SRF) reduces this drawback. SRF eliminates solar power generation variations, grid overvoltage, reverse current, and islanding. Short-term solar radiation forecasts improve photovoltaic (PV) power generation and grid connection. Previous promising SRF studies often fail to generalize to new data. A biogeography-based optimization artificial neural network (BBO-ANN) model for SRF is proposed in this work. 5-year and 6-year data are used to train and validate the model. The data was collected from India\u2019s Jaipur Rajasthan weather station from 2014 to 2019. This work used biogeography-based optimization (BBO) to optimize and adjust the inertia weight of artificial neural networks (ANN) during training. The BBO-ANN model developed in this study had a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.55%, which is promising compared to previous SRF studies. The BBO-ANN SRF model introduced in this work can generalize well to new data because it was able to produce equally accurate autumn and winter forecasts despite the great climatic variation that occurs during the summer and spring. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "Background: MacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography has been a foundation for obtaining testable predictions from models of community assembly and for developing models that integrate across scales and disciplines. Historically, however, these developments have focused on integration across ecological and macroevolutionary scales and on predicting patterns of species richness, abundance distributions, trait data and/or phylogenies. The distribution of genetic variation across species within a community is an emerging pattern that contains signatures of past population histories, which might provide an historical lens for the study of contemporary communities. As intraspecific genetic diversity data become increasingly available at the scale of entire communities, there is an opportunity to integrate microevolutionary processes into our models, moving towards development of a genetic theory of island biogeography. Motivation/goal: We aim to promote the development of process-based biodiversity models that predict community genetic diversity patterns together with other community-scale patterns. To this end, we review models of ecological, microevolutionary and macroevolutionary processes that are best suited to the creation of unified models, and the patterns that these predict. We then discuss ongoing and potential future efforts to unify models operating at different organizational levels, with the goal of predicting multidimensional community-scale data including a genetic component. Main conclusions: Our review of the literature shows that despite recent efforts, further methodological developments are needed, not only to incorporate the genetic component into existing island biogeography models, but also to unify processes across scales of biological organization. To catalyse these developments, we outline two potential ways forward, adopting either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Finally, we highlight key ecological and evolutionary questions that might be addressed by unified models including a genetic component and establish hypotheses about how processes across scales might impact patterns of community genetic diversity. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

            "text": "A hallmark of microbial ecology is that interactions between members of a community shape community function. This includes microbial communities in human infections, such as chronic wounds, where interactions can result in more severe diseases. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism isolated from human chronic wound infections and has been shown to have both cooperative and competitive interactions with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Still, despite considerable study, most interactions between these microbes have been characterized using in vitro well-mixed systems, which do not recapitulate the infection environment. Here, we characterized interactions between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in chronic murine wounds, focusing on the role that both macro- and micro-scale spatial structures play in disease. We discovered that S. aureus and P. aeruginosa coexist at high cell densities in murine wounds. High-resolution imaging revealed that these microbes establish a patchy distribution, only occupying 5 to 25% of the wound volume. Using a quantitative framework, we identified a precise spatial structure at both the macro (mm)- and micro (\u00b5m)-scales, which was largely mediated by P. aeruginosa production of the antimicrobial 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, while the antimicrobial pyocyanin had no impact. Finally, we discovered that this precise spatial structure enhances S. aureus tolerance to aminoglycoside antibiotics but not vancomycin. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the biogeography of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa coinfected wounds and implicate spatial structure as a key determinant of antimicrobial tolerance in wound infections.

            "text": "Understanding the patterns and ecological determinants of \u03b2 diversity in freshwater ecosystems is fundamental to biogeography, conservation biology, and environmental management. It has been proposed that \u03b2 diversity can be divided into contributions of individual sites (LCBD) or species (SCBD) to total \u03b2 diversity. However, the patterns and underlying mechanisms of LCBD and SCBD remain understudied in freshwater fish. Here, using fish assemblages sampled from the Chishui River basin, we analysed \u03b2 diversity based on both abundance and presence-absence data. We also examined the relationships between LCBD and SCBD with site (i.e., community abundance, species richness, functional diversity indices, environmental factors, and spatial variables) and species (i.e., occupancy, total abundance, niche position and breadth, and functional traits) characteristics, respectively. Our results revealed that fish LCBD in the Chishui River basin was well explained by both environmental and spatial factors. Fish LCBD was negatively related to species richness and community abundance, showing that sites with high ecological uniqueness generally supported low fish richness and abundance. Furthermore, functional features of fish assemblages were also significantly associated with LCBD, with high LCBD associated with high functional specialization, originality, and uniqueness, but low functional richness, divergence, and dispersion. Abundance-based SCBD showed positive relationships with both occupancy and total abundance, whereas there were hump-shaped relationships between presence-absence SCBD and occupancy and total abundance. Niche position was negatively correlated with SCBD, whereas niche breadth and functional traits were not significant correlates of SCBD. Overall, this study suggests that understanding contributions of sites and species to \u03b2 diversity is key to understanding biodiversity variation and its applied repercussions. Our results advocate the importance of environmental conditions and between-site connectivity for effective conservation of riverine fish diversity. Moreover, a simultaneous application of LCBD, species richness, SCBD, and rare species would be the most suitable approach for biodiversity conservation. \u00a9 2022"

Because of sampling constraints such as time and cost, conservation biologists have worked to recommend minimum sample sizes that efficiently capture genetic diversity. However, the minimum number of individuals that should be sampled for ex situ collections may vary according to species biogeography, reproductive and dispersal biology, and history. Using simulations, we first aimed to establish minimum sample sizes for 14 IUCN Red List threatened oak species and determine if one minimum sample size can capture the genetic diversity of these closely related species with similar biology and dispersal, but different population sizes and ranges. We found that the answer is no\u2013minimum size ranged from 81 to over 500. Second, we addressed a common concern with simulations\u2013that their predictions may be too dependent on assumptions and may neglect uncertainty. We varied some parameters used for modeling each species in simulations to determine if the minimum sample size changed when this parameter was changed. We determined that the variation in minimum size due to parameter uncertainty was moderate compared to variation due to species' characteristics. Based on this, we propose that simulations may be reliable tools for practical use for many species, even when there is uncertainty in the parameters used for modeling. We conclude that one minimum sample size cannot be recommended to fit all 14 species, but that simulations can help create sampling guidelines tailored to each species. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

C1-2i C2H2-ZFs are a special subclass of conserved proteins that contain two ZnF-C2H2 domains. Some C1-2i C2H2-ZFs in Arabidopsis (ZAT) are involved in stress resistance and other functions. However, there is limited information on C1-2i C2H2-ZFs in Populus trichocarpa (PtriZATs). To analyze the function and evolution of C1-2i C2H2-ZFs, eleven PtriZATs were identified in P. trichocarpa, which can be classified into two subgroups. The protein structure, conserved ZnF-C2H2 domains and QALGGH motifs, showed high conservation during the evolution of PtriZATs in P. trichocarpa. The spacing between two ZnF-C2H2 domains, chromosomal locations and cis-elements implied the original proteins and function of PtriZATs. Furthermore, the gene expression of different tissues and stress treatment showed the functional differentiation of PtriZATs subgroups and their stress response function. The analysis of C1-2i C2H2-ZFs in different Populus species and plants implied their evolution and differentiation, especially in terms of stress resistance. Cis-elements and expression pattern analysis of interaction proteins implied the function of PtriZATs through binding with stress-related genes, which are involved in gene regulation by via epigenetic modification through histone regulation, DNA methylation, ubiquitination, etc. Our results for the origin and evolution of PtriZATs will contribute to understanding the functional differentiation of C1-2i C2H2-ZFs in P. trichocarpa. The interaction and expression results will lay a foundation for the further functional investigation of their roles and biological processes in Populus. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Coolia monotis is the type species of the genus and was the only known species for 76 years. Over the past few decades, molecular characterization has unveiled two species complexes that group morphologically very similar species, so their limits are often unclear. To provide new knowledge on the biogeography and species composition of the genus Coolia, 16 strains were isolated from Bah\u00eda de La Paz, Gulf of California. The species were identified by applying morphological and molecular approaches. The morphometric characteristics of all isolated Coolia species were consistent with the original taxa descriptions. Phylogenetic analyses (large subunit [LSU] rDNA D1 / D2 and internal transcribed spacer [ITS] 1 / 5.8S / ITS2) revealed a species assemblage comprising Coolia malayensis, C. palmyrensis, C. tropicalis, and the C. cf. canariensis lineage. This is the first report of Coolia palmyrensis and C. cf. canariensis in Mexico and C. tropicalis in the Gulf of California. Our results strengthen the biogeographical understanding of these potentially harmful epiphytic dinoflagellate species. \u00a9 2022 The Korean Society of Phycology."

As an interdisciplinary paradigm that leverages both natural and social sciences to better understand linkages between humans and the environment, sustainability science focuses on how these connections shape understandings of and approaches to sustainability challenges. Here, we argue that archaeology and historical ecology are essential components of sustainability science. We view sustainability as a long-term process where historical sciences are critical to effectively measuring where we stand today and modeling future trajectories based on the baselines from the past that archaeology and historical ecology provide. We demonstrate that islands around the world are central to this endeavor because they serve as model systems that can capture the timing of human arrival, subsequent effects of cultural behaviors on pristine environments, and how humans adapted, survived, and often thrived for centuries or millennia. These cases provide important lessons about human responses in the past to similar challenges that we now currently face. In the uncertain futures of the Anthropocene, such historical baselines will contribute significantly to scientific approaches for building more resilient and sustainable societies. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

However, a comprehensive view of protist diversity in freshwaters has been challenged by the immense environmental heterogeneity among lakes worldwide. We assessed protist diversity in the surface waters of 366 freshwater lakes across a north temperate to subarctic range covering nearly 8.4 million km2 of Canada. Sampled lakes represented broad gradients in size, trophic state, and watershed land use. Hypereutrophic lakes contained the least diverse and most distinct protist communities relative to nutrient-poor lakes. Greater taxonomic variation among eutrophic lakes was mainly a product of heterotroph and mixotroph diversity, whereas phototroph assemblages were more similar under high-nutrient conditions. Overall, local physicochemical factors, particularly ion and nutrient concentrations, elicited the strongest responses in community structure, far outweighing the effects of geographic gradients. Despite their contrasting distribution patterns, obligate phototroph and heterotroph turnover was predicted by an overlapping set of environmental factors, while the metabolic plasticity of mixotrophs may have made them less predictable. Notably, protist diversity was associated with variation in watershed soil pH and agricultural crop coverage, pointing to human impact on the land-water interface that has not been previously identified in studies on smaller scales. Our study exposes the importance of both within-lake and external watershed characteristics in explaining protist diversity and biogeography, critical information for further developing an understanding of how freshwater lakes and their watersheds are impacted by anthropogenic stressors. 2022 Garner et al."

            "text": "The fate of plastics in rivers is a key component of the global plastic cycle. Plastics entering freshwater ecosystems are colonized by microbial biofilms, and microbe-plastic interactions can influence ecosystem processes and plastic fate. While literature examining the role of geographic region on plastic biofilms is quickly expanding, research which covers large (i.e., continental) spatial scales and includes freshwater ecosystems is warranted. In addition, most research focuses on bacterial communities, while biofilm eukaryotes are less commonly studied. We assessed biofilm metabolism and community structure on plastic (foamed polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride; PVC) and natural substrates (unglazed ceramic tile) in urban streams spanning a nested geographic gradient in the continental United States. We measured biofilm biomass, community respiration, and chlorophyll a, in addition to assessing marker gene-based community diversity of bacterial, fungal, and algal assemblages. Results demonstrated some substrate-specific trends in biofilm characteristics, including higher biofilm biomass on polystyrene across sites, and lower diversity of bacterial assemblages on both types of plastic litter versus tile. However, there were no differences among substrates for chlorophyll, respiration, and the abundance and diversity of algal and fungal assemblages. Thus, we concluded that the primary driver of biofilm metabolism and community composition were site characteristics, rather than substrate type. Additional studies are needed to quantify which site-specific characteristics drive biofilm dynamics on plastic litter in streams (e.g., water chemistry, light, seasonality, hydrology). These results add to the growing literature on the biofilm \u2018plastisphere\u2019 in aquatic ecosystems, demonstrating that the factors which control the assembly and activity of biofilm communities on plastic substrates (including bacteria, algal, and fungal assemblages together) in urban streams are similar to those driving biofilm dynamics on natural substrates. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V."

            "text": "The Socotra Archipelago, located in the eastern Gulf of Aden, has a unique marine environment, which combines tropical and 'pseudo-temperate' elements. An updated species inventory recently considered its coastal fish diversity the highest among Arabian ecoregions, necessitating to re-assess the ichthyogeographic position of the island group. The main aim of this study is to describe the distributional biogeography of its coastal fish fauna in relation to contemporary ichthyogeographic and ecoregional concepts. Inferences are drawn with regard to the marine biogeographic arrangement and ecoregional partitioning of the Arabian region. The main datasets comprise eight and twenty selected families including 404 and 898 species, respectively, from Arabian ecoregions. The Socotra Archipelago has close affinities to a putative ecoregion in the eastern Gulf of Aden that extends to southern Oman. It is more closely related to the Arabian Sea coast of Oman than to ecoregions in the Red Sea and a putative ecoregion in the western Gulf of Aden. The Gulf of Aden does not represent a consistent ecoregion in ichthyogeographic terms, because its eastern and western parts are less closely related to one another than to other ecoregions. The Socotra Archipelago and the eastern Gulf of Aden should therefore not be assigned to a joined province with Red Sea ecoregions. The coastal fish faunas of the southern Red Sea have close affinities with those of the western Gulf of Aden. The Arabian/Persian Gulf is least related to the other Arabian ecoregions. The authors posit the Socotra Archipelago as a distinct ecoregion, either on its own or in combination with affiliated mainland areas. This best reflects the ichthyogeographic data and the exceptionally high levels of fish and overall marine diversity. Two alternative ecoregional delineations are proposed, serving as working hypotheses for onward research. \u00a9 2022 Zajonz et al.

Despite their worldwide abundance, the genus diversity and biogeographical relationship are relatively less understood at species-level. We evaluated the phylogenetic relationship and genetic diversity among the Pagurus species based on publicly available mitochondrial and nuclear markers. While independent analyses of different markers allowed for larger coverage of taxa and produced largely consistent results, the concatenation of 16S and COI partial sequences led to higher confidence in the phylogenetic relationships. Our analyses established several monophyletic species clusters, substantially corresponding to the previously established morphology-based species groups. The comprehensive species inclusion in the molecular phylogeny resolved the taxonomic position of a number of recently described species that had not been assigned to any morpho-group. In mitochondrial markers-based phylogenies, the \u201cProvenzanoi\u201d group was identified as the basal lineage of Pagurus. The divergence time estimation of the major groups of Pagurus revealed that the Pacific species originated and diversified from the Atlantic lineages around 25\u201351 MYA. The molecular results suggested a higher inter-regional species diversity and complex phylogenetic relationships within the diverse and heterogeneous members of the genus Pagurus. The study presents a comprehensive snapshot of the diversity of pagurid hermit crabs across multiple geographic regions. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Ground beetles of the subfamily Carabinae are flightless except for one lineage, but nevertheless occur on all continents except Antarctica. Here, we used sequence data from ultraconserved elements to reconstruct the phylogeny, divergence time, biogeographical history, ancestral state of hind wings and changes in the speciation rate of Carabinae. Our results show that Carabinae originated in the Americas and diversified into four tribes during the period from the late Jurassic to the late Cretaceous, with two in South America (Celoglossini) and Australasia (Pamborini) and two in Laurasia (Cychrini and Carabini). The ancestral Carabinae were inferred to be winged; three of four tribes (Cychrini, Ceglossini and Pamborini) have completely lost their hind wings and flight capability. The remaining tribe, Carabini, diverged into the subtribes Carabina (wingless) and Calosomina (winged) in the Oligocene. Carabina originated in Europe, spread over Eurasia and diversified into approximately 1000 species, accounting for around 60% of all Carabinae species. Calosomina that were flight-capable dispersed from North America or Eurasia to South America, Australia, and Africa, and then flightless lineages evolved on oceanic islands and continental highlands. The speciation rate increased in the Cychrini and Carabini clades in Eurasia. Within Carabini, the speciation rate was higher for wingless than winged states. Our study showed that the global distribution of Carabinae resulted from ancient dispersal before the breakup of Gondwana and more recent dispersal through flight around the world. These patterns consequently illustrate the causal relationships of geographical history, evolution of flightlessness, and the global distribution and species diversity of Carabinae. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)"

            "text": "The changing Arctic environment is affecting zooplankton that support its abundant wildlife. We examined how these changes are influencing a key zooplankton species, Calanus finmarchicus, principally found in the North Atlantic but expatriated to the Arctic. Close to the ice-edge in the Fram Strait, we identified areas that, since the 1980s, are increasingly favourable to C. finmarchicus. Field-sampling revealed part of the population there to be capable of amassing enough reserves to overwinter. Early developmental stages were also present in early summer, suggesting successful local recruitment. This extension to suitable C. finmarchicus habitat is most likely facilitated by the long-term retreat of the ice-edge, allowing phytoplankton to bloom earlier and for longer and through higher temperatures increasing copepod developmental rates. The increased capacity for this species to complete its life-cycle and prosper in the Fram Strait can change community structure, with large consequences to regional food-webs. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

In Chile, Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni is the only recognized species Gigantolaelaps and it has only been reported from four localities, always in association with Oligoryzomys longicaudatus. Our research study aimed to contribute to the severely limited information about the ecology and distribution of G. wolffsohni in Chile and determine whether factors such as season, ecological region and weight-and sex of the host influence the abundance of this mite. We captured and assessed 329 O. longicaudatus in different seasons and localities. We classified sampled localities as being part of the Mediterranean, Template Forest, or Magellanic Forest ecoregion due to reported genetic and morphological differences of O. longicaudatus between ecoregions. Information about the season, ecoregion, and weight and sex of the host were recorded during mite sampling. These variables were assessed to determine their influence on mite abundance and prevalence through negative binomial and logistic regression models. We found 19 new localities where G. wolffsohni is distributed in Chile. These mites displayed an aggregated distribution in all ecoregions. We found that biogeography, weight, and sex of the host are not related to the abundance and prevalence of G. wolffsohni. Nonetheless, we found a strong association between the season and the abundance and prevalence of mites. All mites found were females; additionally, we found larva stage inside some female mites. We discussed the relationship between different ecological aspects and the abundance and prevalence of ectoparasites. Also, we discussed the finding of the larvae of G. wolffsohni, which means that this specie is at least larviparous, and finally, we discuss the specificity of Laelapidae mites. \u00a9 2022, Les Amis d'Acarologia.

Islands can include any habitat surrounded environments that are inhospitable to the resident species. In arid environments, nurse trees act as islands in an environment uninhabitable to many plant species, and the size of the canopy controls the size of the understory plant community. We predicted that plant species richness will be affected by the area of the habitat and decrease with habitat isolation. We sampled the adult and seedling plant communities at canopy center, canopy edge, and outside canopy microhabitats. We found that species richness in both adult and seedling communities increases with increasing island area. However, richness in seedling communities was greater than in adult communities, and this effect was greatest at the canopy center microhabitat. Competition has been demonstrated to be more important in controlling species distributions near the canopy center, and stress is more important near the canopy edge. Thus, our results suggest that neutral forces, biotic interactions, and abiotic filtering act together to control species richness in these island communities. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Only a few previous studies on large-scale group decision-making (LSDGM) in the big data-driven healthcare Industry 4.0 have focused on this topic. The goal of this work is to improve healthcare management decision-making by developing a new MapReduce-based LSDGM model (MR-LSDGM) for the healthcare Industry 4.0 context. Clustering decision-makers (DM), modelling DM preferences, and classification are the three stages of the MR-LSDGM technique. Furthermore, the DMs are subdivided using a novel biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique combined with fuzzy C-means (FCM). The subgroup preferences are then modelled using the two-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation (2TFLR) technique. The final classification method also includes a feature extractor based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and a classifier based on an ideal extreme learning machine (ELM). MapReduce is a data management platform used to handle massive amounts of data. A thorough set of experimental analyses is carried out, and the results are analysed using a variety of metrics. \u00a9 2022 A. Harshavardhan et al."

However, the ecology and evolution of the host lineage also has a major impact on parasite speciation. Here we explore the interplay between biogeography and host-association on the pattern of diversification in a group of ectoparasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera: Penenirmus) that feeds on the feathers of woodpeckers, barbets, and honeyguides (Piciformes) and some songbirds (Passeriformes). We use whole genome sequencing of 41 ingroup and 12 outgroup samples to develop a phylogenomic dataset of DNA sequences from a reference set of 2395 single copy ortholog genes, for a total of nearly four million aligned base positions. The phylogenetic trees resulting from both concatenated and gene-tree/species-tree coalescent analyses were nearly identical and highly supported. These trees recovered the genus Penenirmus as monophyletic and identified several major clades, which tended to be associated with one major host group. However, cophylogenetic analysis revealed that host-switching was a prominent process in the diversification of this group. This host-switching generally occurred within single major biogeographic regions. We did, however, find one case in which it appears that a rare dispersal event by a woodpecker lineage from North America to Africa allowed its associated louse to colonize a woodpecker in Africa, even though the woodpecker lineage from North America never became established there. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)"

Paleobotanical studies provide a critical source of data on the latitudinal positions of different plant lineages at different times, permitting assessment of the efficacy of the BLB for migration. Here we report exceptionally preserved fossils of Firmiana and Tilia endochrysea from the middle Miocene of South Korea. This represents a new reliable record of Firmiana and the first discovery of the T. endochrysea lineage in the fossil record of Asia. The occurrence of these fossils in South Korea indicates that the two lineages had a distribution that extended much farther north during the middle Miocene, but they were still geographically remote from the BLB. In light of the broader fossil record of Asia, our study shows that, in the middle Miocene, some mesothermal plants apparently inhabited the territory adjacent to the BLB and thus they were possibly capable of utilizing the BLB as a migratory corridor. Some other mesothermal plants, such as Firmiana and the T. endochrysea lineages, however, are restricted to more southern regions relative to the BLB based on current fossil evidence. These lineages may have been ecologically unable to traverse the BLB, which raises questions about the efficacy of the BLB as a universal exchange route for mesothermal plants between Asia and North America during the middle Miocene. \u00a9 2020 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences"

            "text": "Premise: Expanded phylogenetic analyses of the Hawaiian silversword alliance (Argyroxiphium, Dubautia, Wilkesia; Compositae) were undertaken to assess evolutionary and biogeographic informativeness of cytonuclear discordance and any biases in evolutionary directionality of ecological transitions within this prominent example of adaptive radiation. Methods: Samples spanning the geographic and ecological distributions of all recognized taxa were included in phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and cpDNA sequences. Bayesian model testing approaches were used to model ecological evolution and the evolution of nuclear chromosomal arrangements while accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty. Results: Cytonuclear discordance detected previously appears to reflect chloroplast capture, at least in part, with nrDNA trees being largely congruent with nuclear chromosomal structural data and fine-scale taxonomy. Comparison of biogeographic histories estimated from the posterior distributions of nrDNA and cpDNA trees, including inferred chloroplast-capture events, provides additional resolution of dispersal history, including a back-dispersal to Maui Nui from Hawai\u2018i. A newly resolved major nrDNA clade of endemic Kaua\u2018i taxa that mostly were described as new-to-science since the 1980s strengthens the earlier hypothesis that diversification on Kaua\u2018i has not waned since the island began to decline in area through subsidence and erosion. Bias in habitat shifts was estimated, with transitions from dry-to-mesic or -wet and from wet-to-mesic or -bog habitats dominating diversification of the silversword alliance from a dry-adapted tarweed ancestor. Conclusions: The habitat-transition biases estimated here may indicate more limited pathways of ecological evolution than proposed previously for an adaptive radiation involving such major ecological shifts. \u00a9 2021 Botanical Society of America"

Although their biological aspects are well known, cytogenetic information related to this genus remains incipient. In this study, Acanthurus species from populations inhabiting coastal regions of the Southwest Atlantic (SWA), South Atlantic oceanic islands (Fernando de Noronha Archipelago and Trindade Island), Greater Caribbean (GC), and Indo-Pacific Ocean (the center of the origin of the group) were analyzed to investigate their evolutionary differentiation. For this purpose, we employed conventional cytogenetic procedures and fluorescence in situ hybridization of 18S rDNA, 5S rDNA, and H3 and H2B-H2A histone sequences. The Atlantic species (A. coeruleus, A. chirurgus, and A. bahianus) did not show variations among them, despite their vast continental and insular distribution. In contrast, A. coeruleus from SWA and GC diverged from each other in the number of 18S rDNA sites, a condition likely associated with the barrier created by the outflows of the Amazonas/Orinoco rivers. The geminate species A. tractus had a cytogenetic profile similar to that of A. bahianus. However, the chromosomal macrostructures and the distribution of rDNA and hisDNA sequences revealed moderate to higher rates of diversification when Acanthurus species from recently colonized areas (Atlantic Ocean) were compared to A. triostegus, a representative species from the Indian Ocean. Our cytogenetic data covered all Acanthurus species from the Western Atlantic, tracked phylogenetic diversification throughout the dispersive process of the genus, and highlighted the probable diversifying role of ocean barriers in this process.

This study aims to untangle the possible drivers of intraspecific molecular diversity by testing whether patterns of historical climatic stability or contemporary range position correlate with molecular diversity. Location: South African coastline. Taxa: The cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), common shore crab (Cyclograpsus punctatus) and granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis). Methods: Species distributions were hindcasted to the Last Glacial Maximum to assess the biogeography of the study species. Linear models were built to compare the relationships between historical climatic stability or contemporary distributional ranges with extant genetic (mtDNA) and genomic (SNP) diversity. Results: We found large differences in the historical ranges among species and time periods. Regions of higher habitat stability corresponded to regions of higher molecular diversity, but historical climatic variability was not a predictor of molecular diversity within linear models. Lower genetic diversity values, and higher genetic differentiation, were detected in edge populations, but this was not consistent across marker type or species. Main conclusions: Both historical and contemporary processes are potentially driving patterns of diversity, but a large portion of the variation in molecular diversity remains unexplained. Our findings suggest that marine species within cool-temperate bioregions in the Southern Hemisphere may have more complex biogeographic and evolutionary histories than terrestrial taxa and/or coastal species within northern, formerly glaciated regions. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

The complex relationships between these counteracting processes \u2013 community reassembly and spatial self-organization \u2013 have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to imposed water stress of increasing degrees. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial re-patterning buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure. \u00a9 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

However, only a few studies on the archaeal community in mangroves have been reported. In particular, the assembly processes and interaction patterns that impact the archaeal communities in mangroves have not been investigated to date. Here, the biogeography, assembly patterns, and driving factors of archaeal communities in seven representative mangroves across southeastern China were systematically analyzed. The analysis revealed that the archaeal community is more diverse in surface sediments than in subsurface sediments, and more diverse in mangroves at low latitudes than at high latitudes, with Woesearchaeota and Bathyarchaeota as the most diverse and most abundant phyla, respectively. Beta nearest-taxon index analysis suggested a determinant role of homogeneous selection on the overall archaeon community in all mangroves and in each individual mangrove. In addition, the conditionally rare taxon community was strongly shaped by homogeneous selection, while stochastic processes shaped the dominant taxon and alwaysrare taxon communities. Further, a moderate effect of environmental selection on the archaeal community was noted, with the smallest effect on the always-rare taxon community. Mangrove location, mean annual temperature, and salinity were the major factors that greatly affected the community composition. Finally, network analysis revealed comprehensive cooccurrence relationships in the archaeal community, with a crucial role of Bathyarchaeota. This study expands the understanding of the biogeography, assembly patterns, driving factors, and cooccurrence relationships of the mangrove archaeal community and inspires functional exploration of archaeal resources in mangrove sediments. \u00a9 2021 Zhang et al."

Due to illegal harvesting for its wood, the population tends to decrease every year, so rapid conservation effort was needed. D. oblongifolia and D. lanceolata were important members of dryobalanops, which have listed as endangered (EN), according to IUCN. This study aims to provide information on the DNA isolation and amplification process. This data was needed as basic information for further research, such as genetic diversity, population genetics, phylogeny studies, or biogeography aspects. DNA isolation was performed using the CTAB method (Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide). The amplification process was performed with three barcode markers those were trnL-trnF, rbcL, and matK. The results of DNA isolation showed quite good DNA yield. Amplified DNA using all primers showed successfully with an annealing temperature of 490C for matK, 500C for trnL-trnF, and 550 C for rbcL.  \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

            "text": "Red sage (Salvia miltiorrhiza) is a widely used medicinal plant for treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Because of excessive excavation by huge market demand and habitat loss by human activities, the wild population resources of S. miltiorrhiza have reduced drastically in recent years. Meanwhile, population status of two closely related species S. bowleyana and S. paramiltiorrhiza were in a trend of decreasing due to their potential replacement of S. miltiorrhiza. Particularly, S. paramiltiorrhiza was threatened and endemic to a small region in eastern China. However, to date there has been no conservation genetic research reported for wild S. miltiorrhiza population and its endangered relatives. Assess the wild germplasm diversity for S. miltiorrhiza and its related species would provide fundamental genetic background for cultivation and molecular breeding of this medicinally important species. In the present study, we investigated the genetic diversity, population structure, and intra/inter-specific differentiation of S. miltiorrhiza and above two relatives using 2b-RAD genome-wide genotyping method. By investigating 81 individuals of S. miltiorrhiza, 55 individuals of S. bowleyana and 15 individuals of S. paramiltiorrhiza from 23 locations in China, we obtained 23,928 SNPs in total. A comparatively high genetic diversity was observed in S. miltiorrhiza (\u03c0 = 0.0788, He = 0.0783 \u00b1 0.0007). The observed and expected heterozygosity in populations of these three species ranged from 0.0297 to 0.1481 and 0.0251 to 0.831, respectively. Two major lineage groups were detected in the examined S. miltiorrhiza populations. The results indicated that Dabie Mountain as a genetic diversity center of S. miltiorrhiza and possible complex inter-specific genetic exchange/hybridization occurred between S. miltiorrhiza and the two relatives. We suggest that strategic conservation and germplasm preservation should be considered not only for wild populations of S. miltiorrhiza, but also for its related S. bowleyana and S. paramiltiorrhiza. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Zhou, Zhang, Huang, Xiao, Wu, Qi and Wei."

However, although these ecosystem engineers have a facilitating role for some species, they may exclude or compete with others. The honeycomb worm Sabellaria alveolata (Linnaeus, 1767) is an important foundation species, commonly found from northwest Ireland to northern Mauritania, whose reef structures increase the physical complexity of the marine benthos, supporting high levels of biodiversity. Local patterns and regional differences in taxonomic and functional diversity were examined in honeycomb worm reefs from 10 sites along the northeastern Atlantic to explore variation in diversity across biogeographic regions and the potential effects of environmental drivers. While taxonomic composition varied across the study sites, levels of diversity remained relatively constant along the European coast. Assemblages showed high levels of species turnover compared to differences in richness, which varied primarily in response to sea surface temperatures and sediment content, the latter suggesting that local characteristics of the reef had a greater effect on community composition than the density of the engineering species. In contrast, the functional composition of assemblages was similar regardless of taxonomic composition or biogeography, with five functional groups being observed in all sites and only small differences in abundance in these groups being detected. Functional groups represented primarily filter-feeders and deposit-feeders, with the notable absence of herbivores, indicating that the reefs may act as biological filters for some species from the local pool of organisms. Redundancy was observed within functional groups that may indicate that honeycomb worm reefs can offer similar niche properties to its associated assemblages across varying environmental conditions. These results highlight the advantages of comparing taxonomic and functional metrics, which allow identification of a number of ecological processes that structure marine communities. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Muller, Poitrimol, Nunes, Boy\u00e9, Curd, Desroy, Firth, Bush, Davies, Lima, Marzloff, Meneghesso, Seabra and Dubois."

While both environmental conditions and evolutionary history shape trait biogeography, their relative contributions are largely unknown for most organisms. Here, we explore the global biogeography of reef fish traits for 2,786 species from 89 ecoregions spanning eight marine realms with contrasting environmental conditions and evolutionary histories. Across realms, we found a common structure in the distribution of species traits despite a 10-fold gradient in species richness, with a defined \u201cbackbone\u201d of 21 trait combinations shared by all realms globally, both temperate and tropical. Across ecoregions, assemblages under similar environmental conditions had similar trait compositions despite hosting drastically different species pools from separate evolutionary lineages. Thus, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers and millions of years of evolution, similar environments host similar trait compositions in reef fish assemblages worldwide. Our findings suggest that similar trait-based management strategies can be applied among regions with distinct species pools, potentially improving conservation outcomes across diverse jurisdictions. \u00a9 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Clonal reproduction, colony formation, and modular organization have important consequences for many aspects of organismal biology. Theories in ecology, evolution, and development are often based on unitary and, mainly, strictly sexually reproducing organisms, and though colonial animals dominate many marine ecosystems and habitats, recognized concepts for the study of clonal species are often lacking. In this review, we present an overview of the study of colonial and clonal animals, from the historic interests in this subject to modern research in a range of topics, including immunology, stem cell biology, aging, biogeography, and ecology. We attempt to portray the fundamental questions lying behind the biology of colonial animals, focusing on how colonial animals challenge several dogmas in biology as well as the remaining puzzles still to be answered, of which there are many. \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Here we propose a new biogeographical regionalization of cultivated cacao for Colombia. We used spatial partitioning, geospatial mapping of macro/microclimate variables and a hierarchical area taxonomy classification to describe, define and propose the biogeographical regions of cultivated cacao. The cacao regions were identified from distributions of 4,974 cocoa producing farms across Colombia. Our proposed regionalization comprises four regions (north-eastern, north-western, south-western, east), 31 sub-regions and 54 provinces. Solar radiation, precipitation, and soil temperature seasonality best explained the biogeographical regions. Rivers networks helped explain the differences at the sub-regional and provinces level. Our results indicate that biogeography is a strong indicator of cacao's agricultural expansion across the different growing regions in Colombia. This up-to-date biogeographical classification could be a useful tool for agricultural planning of cacao in Colombia. Particularly, the baseline information provided might be of use on the development of denominations of origin for cacao. Copyright \u00a9 2022 Gonz\u00e1lez-Orozco and Pesca."

            "text": "Climate change presents a particularly complex challenge in the context of flyway scale conservation of migratory bird species as it requires coordinated action by multiple countries along these species' migratory routes. Coordinating conservation responses requires understanding the vulnerability of species and their habitats to climate change at the flyway scale throughout each species' annual cycle. To contribute to such understanding, we used species distribution models to assess the exposure to climate change of waterbird species that are the focus of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). We found that the species with the smallest proportion of their current range projected to be climatically suitable by 2050 (those whose distributions respond to changes in water availability but that do not perform synchronised migration) are dispersive species in the Afrotropical biogeographic realm, and migratory species in their breeding season, particularly Arctic breeding waders. These species also have the most limited availability of newly suitable areas. Projections for most other Palearctic migratory waterbird species suggest that losses of suitable areas in their current passage and wintering ranges may be largely offset by new areas becoming climatically suitable. The majority of migratory Palearctic waterbirds in the breeding season and Afrotropical waterbirds are widely dispersed with only a small proportion of their populations currently supported by 'Critical Sites' (i.e. sites that are either important for Globally Threatened Species or support 1% of the bioregional population of any waterbird species). This makes it unlikely that climate change adaptation measures focusing only on key sites will be sufficient to counter the predicted range losses. Therefore, climate change adaptation responses should also be implemented at the landscape scale for Afrotropical waterbirds and for breeding populations of Palearctic migrant waterbirds. \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021."

Haplanthodes differs from Andrographis by the presence of cladodes in the inflorescences, subactinomorphic flowers, stamens included within the corolla tube, pouched stamens and oblate pollen grains. To understand the phylogenetic relationship of Haplanthodes, Andrographis and Haplanthus, which are putatively closely related taxa, we used four plastid markers, matK, rbcL, psbA-trnH and trnGRto construct a molecular phylogeny. Our results established the monophyly of Haplanthodes and revealed a sister relationship to Andrographis and Haplanthus. Further, to understand the historical biogeography of the genus, we inferred the divergence time and performed an ancestral area reconstruction. Our analyses suggest that Haplanthodes evolved during Late Miocene 5.85 Ma (95%HPD: 2.18\u201310.34 Ma) in peninsular India where it might have shared a common ancestor with Andrographis. To understand character evolution, the ancestral states of important morphological characters were inferred and discussed based on the equal rate model. The generic status of Haplanthus was not resolved due to incomplete sampling. \u00a9 2022 Nordic Society Oikos. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The main characteristics for the identification and classification of stomatocysts include pore, collar, annulus, and ornamentation. Because of their sensitivity to aquatic environmental changes, chrysophyte stomatocysts are broadly used in studies of aquatic environmental change, including reconstruction of paleotemperature and paleohydrology and assessment of lake eutrophication and acidification. Existing studies are mainly conducted in North America and Europe but few investigations exist in other regions. Compared with other bioindicators, the identification of stomatocysts is much more complex, probably limiting their broad application. Future studies should improve the identification and classification methods of stomatocysts in order to promote efficiency of identification and counting. Furthermore, modern investigation of stomatocysts should be strengthened to reveal global stomatocyst diversity and their ecological attributes, particularly in regions outside of Europe and North America. On these bases, applications of stomatocysts in the fields of peatland environmental change and biogeography should be strengthened. \u00a9 2022, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

Taxonomic review, based on vegetative and associated reproductive organs, supports Mamay's assignment to Sphenopteridium Schimper. However, the species, Sphenopteridium manzanitanum Mamay is vegetatively identical to Sphenopteris germanica Weiss. We review Sphenopteris germanica, concluding that it should be assigned to Sphenopteridium, and that S. manzanitanum should be considered a later homonym, and placed in synonymy of S. germanicum. Arnophyton kuesii is obviously a juvenile version of the same species. The principal study specimen has a growth habit consisting of a short, subterranean or surficial, mound-like stem bearing a tuft of ascendant leaves and a vertically disposed taproot, so it was a low-growing, upright form. The study specimen is of sufficient size to suggest that this is the mature growth configuration, but it does not represent the maximum size the species could attain, based on excavated leaves much larger than those found in attachment. Inferred from its sedimentary context, the specimen was likely growing along a river or estuary bank and was incorporated whole as the bank eroded and collapsed, resulting in transport into the embayment in which the Kinney flora and fauna were preserved. Sphenopteridium germanicum plants were, thus, relatively small and low growing; there is no evidence of laterally initiated stems or plantlets indicative of a clonal growth form. The growth habit reported here is new, enlarging the range of growth architectures known in late Paleozoic plants, thus spotlighting the morphological richness that had evolved by that time, despite significantly lower diversity than that of the modern world. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V."

They have become important natural models for ecological and evolutionary research, yet prior efforts to resolve phylogenetic relationships have resulted in conflicting topologies and weak support for certain relationships. Here, we use genomic data generated with a reduced representation double-digest RADseq approach to reassess evolutionary relationships across Thamnophis. We then use the resulting phylogeny to better understand how biogeography and feeding ecology have influenced lineage diversification and morphological evolution. We recovered highly congruent and strongly supported topologies from maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, but some discordance with a multispecies coalescent approach. All phylogenomic estimates split Thamnophis into two clades largely defined by northern and southern North American species. Divergence time estimates and biogeographic analyses indicate a mid-Miocene origin of Thamnophis in Mexico. In addition, historic vicariant events thought to explain biogeographic patterns in other lineages (e.g., Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Rocky Mountain Range, and Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt) appear to have influenced patterns of diversification in Thamnophis as well. Analyses of morphological traits associated with feeding ecology showed moderate to strong phylogenetic signal. Nevertheless, phylogenetic ANOVA suggested significant differences in certain cranial morphologies between aquatic specialists and garter snakes that are terrestrial-aquatic generalists, independent of evolutionary history. Our new estimate of Thamnophis phylogeny yields an improved understanding of the biogeographic history and morphological evolution of garter snakes, and provides a robust framework for future research on these snakes. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc."

            "text": "Taxonomic study from a late Miocene Fossil locality Dhok Bun Ameer Khatoon, Lower Siwalik Hills of Pakistan has been conducted. New fossil remains belong to family Giraffidae which include right and left maxilla, isolated upper premolars and molars. After morphological and comparative analysis, the collection is attributed to Giraffokeryx punjabiensis and Giraffa priscilla. Size variation in dentition is taxonomically important for vertebrate evolutionary point of view and this is the main reason to conduct this study at this specific site to add additional information about family Giraffidae. The fossil site has well exposed Chinji and Nagri Formation and has dated approximately 14.2-9.5 Ma. In this study, different aspects of evolution, taxonomy and biogeographic distribution as well as the relation of Giraffidae with Procerotidae have been discussed comprehensively. Palaeoenvironment, biostratigraphy and geology of the locality have also been discussed. The coexistence of Giraffokeryx punjabiens with its mammalian paleo-community reveals the persistence of mosaics of diverse habitats ranging from tropical evergreen forest to subtropical ones, closed seasonal woodlands to wooded savannas during the deposition of the Dhok Bun Ameer Khatoon, Chinji Formation.

            "text": "Background: New records of alien land planarians are regularly reported worldwide, and some correspond to undescribed species of unknown geographic origin. The description of new species of land planarians (Geoplanidae) should classically be based on both external morphology and histology of anatomical structures, especially the copulatory organs, ideally with the addition of molecular data. Methods: Here, we describe the morphology and reproductive anatomy of a species previously reported as Diversibipalium \"black\", and the morphology of a species previously reported as Diversibipalium \"blue\". Based on next generation sequencing, we obtained the complete mitogenome of five species of Bipaliinae, including these two species. Results: The new species Humbertium covidum n. sp. (syn: Diversibipalium \"black\"of Justine et al., 2018) is formally described on the basis of morphology, histology and mitogenome, and is assigned to Humbertium on the basis of its reproductive anatomy. The type-locality is Casier, Italy, and other localities are in the Department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, France; some published or unpublished records suggest that this species might also be present in Russia, China, and Japan. The mitogenomic polymorphism of two geographically distinct specimens (Italy vs France) is described; the cox1 gene displayed 2.25% difference. The new species Diversibipalium mayottensis n. sp. (syn: Diversibipalium \"blue\"of Justine et al., 2018) is formally described on the basis of external morphology and complete mitogenome and is assigned to Diversibipalium on the basis of an absence of information on its reproductive anatomy. The type- and only known locality is the island of Mayotte in the Mozambique Channel off Africa. Phylogenies of bipaliine geoplanids were constructed on the basis of SSU, LSU, mitochondrial proteins and concatenated sequences of cox1, SSU and LSU. In all four phylogenies, D. mayottensis was the sister-group to all the other bipaliines. With the exception of D. multilineatum which could not be circularised, the complete mitogenomes of B. kewense, B. vagum, B. adventitium, H. covidum and D. mayottensis were colinear. The 16S gene in all bipaliine species was problematic because usual tools were unable to locate its exact position. Conclusion: Next generation sequencing, which can provide complete mitochondrial genomes as well as traditionally used genes such as SSU, LSU and cox1, is a powerful tool for delineating and describing species of Bipaliinae when the reproductive structure cannot be studied, which is sometimes the case of asexually reproducing invasive species. The unexpected position of the new species D. mayottensis as sister-group to all other Bipaliinae in all phylogenetic analyses suggests that the species could belong to a new genus, yet to be described.  \u00a9 2022 Justine et al."

Limited information was available about the colouration, systematics, ecology, and biogeography of N. laurae. We provide new data on the external morphology, colouration, distribution and comment on its conservation status and extinction risk. We discuss the phylogenetic relationships of N. laurae, which forms a clade together with N. siren and N. humboldti.

In contrast to NEON\u2019s extensive use of automated instruments to collect environmental data, NEON\u2019s biodiversity surveys are almost entirely conducted using traditional human-centric field methods. We believe that the combination of instrumentation for remote data collection and machine learning models to process such data represents an important opportunity for NEON to expand the scope, scale, and usability of its biodiversity data collection while potentially reducing long-term costs. In this manuscript, we first review the current status of instrument-based biodiversity surveys within the NEON project and previous research at the intersection of biodiversity, instrumentation, and machine learning at NEON sites. We then survey methods that have been developed at other locations but could potentially be employed at NEON sites in future. Finally, we expand on these ideas in five case studies that we believe suggest particularly fruitful future paths for automated biodiversity measurement at NEON sites: acoustic recorders for sound-producing taxa, camera traps for medium and large mammals, hydroacoustic and remote imagery for aquatic diversity, expanded remote and ground-based measurements for plant biodiversity, and laboratory-based imaging for physical specimens and samples in the NEON biorepository. Through its data science-literate staff and user community, NEON has a unique role to play in supporting the growth of such automated biodiversity survey methods, as well as demonstrating their ability to help answer key ecological questions that cannot be answered at the more limited spatiotemporal scales of human-driven surveys. \u00a9 2021 The Authors."

Autophagy-related gene 13 (atg13) is one essential gene for autophagy initiation, yet the evolutionary trends of the atg13 gene at the usages of nucleotide and synonymous codon remains unexplored. According to phylogenetic analyses for the atg13 gene of 226 eukaryotic organisms at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, it is clear that their nucleotide usages exhibit more genetic information than their amino acid usages. Specifically, the overall nucleotide usage bias quantified by information entropy reflected that the usage biases at the first and second codon positions were stronger than those at the third position of the atg13 genes. Furthermore, the bias level of nucleotide \u2018G\u2019 usage is highest, while that of nucleotide \u2018C\u2019 usage is lowest in the atg13 genes. On top of that, genetic features represented by synonymous codon usage exhibits a species-specific pattern on the evolution of the atg13 genes to some extent. Interestingly, the codon usages of atg13 genes in the ancestor animals (Latimeria chalumnae, Petromyzon marinus, and Rhinatrema bivittatum) are strongly influenced by mutation pressure from nucleotide composition constraint. However, the distributions of nucleotide composition at different codon positions in the atg13 gene display that natural selection still dominates atg13 codon usages during organisms\u2019 evolution. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Li, Wang, Wang, Pu, Feng, Jin, Ma and Ma."

Location: Western Eurasia. Taxon: Vascular plants. Methods: We delimited nine regions encompassing the variability of TDFs in Western Eurasia and collected 1000 vegetation plots from each.\u00a0We deconstructed the plant communities into three layers, tree, shrub and floor. We used (i) generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to analyse the influence of current climate, historical climate and topography on species richness by accounting for regional effects and (ii) redundancy analysis (RDA) with variance partitioning to describe the variation in life forms along abiotic gradients. The three forest layers were analysed jointly and separately. Results: The Balkans, Alps and Carpathians appeared to be the richest in plant species, whereas the British Isles and the Hyrcanian region were the poorest. Annual temperature range and annual mean temperature were the best predictors of species richness for the whole dataset and for the shrub layer. The tree layer richness was mainly explained by the annual temperature range and by elevation, whereas the forest floor richness was more related to the annual temperature range and the annual mean temperature differences between the LGM and current climate. The current climate was the main predictor of the composition of the whole community, the tree layer and the floor layer, while the shrub layer was also influenced by historical climate. Main conclusions: Our overview of the diversity of temperate deciduous forests in Western Eurasia demonstrates different patterns and drivers across life-forms and forest layers. While the diversity of trees is mainly linked to current climatic conditions, the shrub layer is also driven by postglacial-glacial climatic stability, suggesting a different origin from forest trees. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

            "text": "Carex subgenus Psyllophorae is an engaging study group due to its early diversification compared to most Carex lineages, and its remarkable disjunct distribution in four continents corresponding to three independent sections: sect. Psyllophorae in Western Palearctic, sect. Schoenoxiphium in Afrotropical region, and sect. Junciformes in South America (SA) and SW Pacific. The latter section is mainly distributed in Patagonia and the Andes, where it is one of the few Carex groups with a significant in situ diversification. We assess the role of historical geo-climatic events in the evolutionary history of the group, particularly intercontinental colonization events and diversification processes, with an emphasis on SA. We performed an integrative study using phylogenetic (four DNA regions), divergence times, diversification rates, biogeographic reconstruction, and bioclimatic niche evolution analyses. The crown age of subg. Psyllophorae (early Miocene) supports this lineage as one of the oldest within Carex. The diversification rate probably decreased over time in the whole subgenus. Geography seems to have played a primary role in the diversification of subg. Psyllophorae. Inferred divergence times imply a diversification scenario away from primary Gondwanan vicariance hypotheses and suggest long-distance dispersal-mediated allopatric diversification. Section Junciformes remained in Northern Patagonia since its divergence until Plio-Pleistocene glaciations. Andean orogeny appears to have acted as a northward corridor, which contrasts with the general pattern of North-to-South migration for temperate-adapted organisms. A striking niche conservatism characterizes the evolution of this section. Colonization of the SW Pacific took place on a single long-distance dispersal event from SA. The little ecological changes involved in the trans-Pacific disjunction imply the preadaptation of the group prior to the colonization of the SW Pacific. The high species number of the section results from simple accumulation of morphological changes (disparification), rather than shifts in ecological niche related to increased diversification rates (radiation). \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Ben\u00edtez-Ben\u00edtez, Otero, Ford, Garc\u00eda-Moro, Donad\u00edo, Luce\u00f1o, Mart\u00edn-Bravo and Jim\u00e9nez-Mej\u00edas."

Prior work had shown that there was partial reproductive isolation when plants from South Carolina were hybridized with any of the other varieties but evidence of morphological differentiation was lacking. In this study, a new morphological analysis showed South Carolina plants differed significantly in corolla lobe size, sepal size, and leaf dissection in comparisons with neighboring varieties, P. dubia var. dubia and P. dubia var. georgiana. A preponderance of evidence showing differentiation from all other varieties supports recognition of a new variety, P. dubia var. rionensis. Field work and an updated analysis of herbarium records showed the new variety is found in nine contiguous counties in the central and northern Piedmont of South Carolina and two counties in the inner Coastal Plain. We posit a hypothesized biogeographic pathway based on migration of a P. dubia ancestor from the Great Plains or Mexico to the Nashville Basin cedar glades, then to South Carolina piedmont granite outcrops, followed by a migration south to Georgia and Alabama piedmont granite outcrops and a separate migration north to rocky woodlands in North Carolina. \u00a9 2021 Torrey Botanical Society.

            "text": "The marine picoeukaryote Bathycoccus prasinos has been considered a cosmopolitan alga, although recent studies indicate two ecotypes exist, Clade BI (B. prasinos) and Clade BII. Viruses that infect Bathycoccus Clade BI are known (BpVs), but not that infect BII. We isolated three dsDNA prasinoviruses from the Sargasso Sea against Clade BII isolate RCC716. The BII-Vs do not infect BI, and two (BII-V2 and BII-V3) have larger genomes (~210 kb) than BI-Viruses and BII-V1. BII-Vs share ~90% of their proteins, and between 65% to 83% of their proteins with sequenced BpVs. Phylogenomic reconstructions and PolB analyses establish close-relatedness of BII-V2 and BII-V3, yet BII-V2 has 10-fold higher infectivity and induces greater mortality on host isolate RCC716. BII-V1 is more distant, has a shorter latent period, and infects both available BII isolates, RCC716 and RCC715, while BII-V2 and BII-V3 do not exhibit productive infection of the latter in our experiments. Global metagenome analyses show Clade BI and BII algal relative abundances correlate positively with their respective viruses. The distributions delineate BI/BpVs as occupying lower temperature mesotrophic and coastal systems, whereas BII/BII-Vs occupy warmer temperature, higher salinity ecosystems. Accordingly, with molecular diagnostic support, we name Clade BII Bathycoccus calidus sp. nov. and propose that molecular diversity within this new species likely connects to the differentiated host-virus dynamics observed in our time course experiments. Overall, the tightly linked biogeography of Bathycoccus host and virus clades observed herein supports species-level host specificity, with strain-level variations in infection parameters. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

            "text": "The hypothesis that biotic interactions strengthen toward lower latitudes provides a framework for linking community-scale processes with the macroecological scales that define our biosphere. Despite the importance of this hypothesis for understanding community assembly and ecosystem functioning, the extent to which interaction strength varies across latitude and the effects of this variation on natural communities remain unresolved. Predation in particular is central to ecological and evolutionary dynamics across the globe, yet very few studies explore both community-scale causes and outcomes of predation across latitude. Here we expand beyond prior studies to examine two important components of predation strength: intensity of predation (including multiple dimensions of the predator guild) and impact on prey community biomass and structure, providing one of the most comprehensive examinations of predator\u2013prey interactions across latitude. Using standardized experiments, we tested the hypothesis that predation intensity and impact on prey communities were stronger at lower latitudes. We further assessed prey recruitment to evaluate the potential for this process to mediate predation effects. We used sessile marine invertebrate communities and their fish predators in nearshore environments as a model system, with experiments conducted at 12 sites in four regions spanning the tropics to the subarctic. Our results show clear support for an increase in both predation intensity and impact at lower relative to higher latitudes. The predator guild was more diverse at low latitudes, with higher predation rates, longer interaction durations, and larger predator body sizes, suggesting stronger predation intensity in the tropics. Predation also reduced prey biomass and altered prey composition at low latitudes, with no effects at high latitudes. Although recruitment rates were up to three orders of magnitude higher in the tropics than the subarctic, prey replacement through this process was insufficient to dampen completely the strong impacts of predators in the tropics. Our study provides a novel perspective on the biotic interaction hypothesis, suggesting that multiple components of the predator community likely contribute to predation intensity at low latitudes, with important consequences for the structure of prey communities. \u00a9 2021 by the Ecological Society of America"

            "text": "Studies of the diet, feeding habits and trophic activity of top marine predators are essential for understanding their trophodynamics. The main direct method used for such studies thus far has been morphological inventories of stomach contents. This approach presents limitations such as missing gelatinous prey, which are usually digested too quickly to be detectable. Here, we analysed the stomachs of 48 Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus, approximately 15 to 60 kg, including juveniles and adult fishes) collected from the Mediterranean Sea through the metabarcoding of two gene regions (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and the ribosomal 18S-V1V2 region). The identified prey taxa and their relative read abundances (RRAs) estimated using COI results were in line with the findings of morphologically based inventories simultaneously performed on the same set of tuna samples. In both cases (and with the same rankings), the prey taxa included anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus, here detected in more than 80% of samples, RRA = 43%), sardine (Sardina pilchardus, also approximately 80%, RRA = 30%), sprat (Sprattus sprattus, approximately 66%, RRA = 8%), mackerel (Scomber colias, approximately 44%, RRA = 7%) and cephalopods (approximately 15%, RRA = 1.4%). Another striking result was the detection, based on 18S (with which vertebrates were detected as the most abundant group, RRA = 61.6%), of a high prevalence and diversity of gelatinous organisms (RRA = 27.1%), including cnidarians (6.7%), salps (11.7%), and ctenophores (8.7%), the latter increasing with the size of the predator. These results thus support the hypothesis of the role of gelatinous prey in the diet of Atlantic bluefin tuna, suggesting that this species is even more generalist and opportunistic than previously thought. This study further confirms that DNA metabarcoding can be a powerful tool for assessing the diet and trophodynamics of top marine predators. Copyright \u00a9 2021 G\u00fcnther et al."

According to morphological traits, the section has been proposed to split into two sections (sects. Confertiflorae sensu Ohwi and Molliculae Ohwi) up to five different ones (sects. Confertiflorae s.s., Molliculae, Dispalatae Ohwi, Ischnostachyae Ohwi, and Alliiformes Akiyama). Recent phylogenetic reconstructions showed Confertiflorae s.l. not to be monophyletic, as species traditionally considered part of it were found to belong to other clades, whereas species traditionally ascribed to other sections were nested within it. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic structure, morphological affinities, and biogeographic history of sect. Confertiflorae s.l. We employed a taxon-based approach to explore the morphological affinities of the species considered in sect. Confertiflorae and compared the micromorphology of the nutlets of almost all the taxa using SEM. We included 40 samples representing 31 species/subspecies of sect. Confertiflorae s.l. and used two nuclear (ETS and ITS) and three plastid (trnL-F, matK, and rpl32-trnL UAG) molecular markers to reconstruct the phylogeny of the group. The phylogenetic analyses confirmed the polyphyly of sect. Confertiflorae s.l., whose representatives were found within five distinct clades. From these, two clades, sect. Confertiflorae and sect. Molliculae, were found to be closely related and contained the majority of the species. The composition of the two clades agreed with the morphological structure of the group, and we confirmed an exclusive combination of features (namely color of basal sheaths, presence of bract sheath, peduncle of lowest spike, inflorescence sex distribution, shape of pistillate glume apex, and color and veins of utricle, among others) characterizing each of the two clades. The origin of the two clades was found to be in the early Pliocene; however, the majority of the diversification events within each clade took place during the Pleistocene. This illustrates that although Asia has been regarded as having little potential ecological space for Carex to diversify due to its climate stability, groups of sedges sub-endemic from that area may have a fairly recent origin related to glaciations. We proposed the rearrangement of sect. Confertiflorae as previously conceived as three independent sections: the monotypic Alliiformes, sect. Molliculae, and sect.

The disruptions these microbial communities may experience during and following polymetallic nodule mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) of the North Pacific Ocean could therefore have broad ecological effects. Our goals in this synthesis are to characterize the current understanding of biodiversity and biogeography of bacteria and archaea in the CCZ and to identify gaps in the baseline data and sampling approaches, prior to the onset of mining in the region. This is part of a large effort to compile biogeographic patterns in the CCZ, and to assess the representivity of no-mining Areas of Particular Environmental Interest, across a range of taxa. Here, we review published studies and an additional new dataset focused on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon characterization of abyssal bacterial and archaeal communities, particularly focused on spatial patterns. Deep-sea habitats (nodules, sediments, and bottom seawater) each hosted significantly different microbial communities. An east-vs.-west CCZ regional distinction was present in nodule communities, although the magnitude was small and likely not detectable without a high-resolution analysis. Within habitats, spatial variability was driven by differences in relative abundances of taxa, rather than by abundant taxon turnover. Our results further support observations that nodules in the CCZ have distinct archaeal communities from those in more productive surrounding regions, with higher relative abundances of presumed chemolithoautotrophic Nitrosopumilaceae suggesting possible trophic effects of nodule removal. Collectively, these results indicate that bacteria and archaea in the CCZ display previously undetected, subtle, regional-scale biogeography. However, the currently available microbial community surveys are spatially limited and suffer from sampling and analytical differences that frequently confound inter-comparison; making definitive management decisions from such a limited dataset could be problematic. We suggest a number of future research priorities and sampling recommendations that may help to alleviate dataset incompatibilities and to address challenges posed by rapidly advancing DNA sequencing technology for monitoring bacterial and archaeal biodiversity in the CCZ. Most critically, we advocate for selection of a standardized 16S rRNA gene amplification approach for use in the anticipated large-scale, contractor-driven biodiversity monitoring in the region. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Wear, Church, Orcutt, Shulse, Lindh and Smith."

To evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of the potential cross-contamination routes, we conducted a biogeographical assessment of bacteria in a foodservice facility based on the diversity of microflora on each surface. To this end, we performed high-throughput amplicon sequencing of 13 food-contact and non-food contact surfaces in a foodservice facility throughout a year. The results showed that Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Streptophyta, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Enhydrobacter, Staphylococcus, Paracoccus, and Lysinibacillus were the dominant genera found on the kitchen surfaces of the foodservice facility. Depending on the season, changes in Firmicute/Proteobacteria ratios were observed, and the fan becomes the main source of outdoor air contamination. The microbial flow associated with spoilage was also observed throughout food preparation. Taken together, our results would be a powerful reference to hygiene managers for improvement of food processes. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Lim, Kim, Sul, Kim, Kim, Kim and Koo."

Unencysted metacercariae of Tylodelphys sp. inhabit the cranial cavity of the fish Galaxias maculatus; however, to date they have not been documented to alter their host behavior. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of Tylodelphys sp. inhabiting the cranial cavity of Galaxias maculatus on host physiology and swimming behavior as well as its reaction to a simulated predation attempt. Blind experiments in the lab were carried out on 56 fish that were filmed individually. The Fulton condition factor (K) was used as an approximation of nutritional status and a respirometry chamber was used to evaluate oxygen consumption rates of fish. Of the 56 fish, 21 were parasitized by Tylodelphys sp. (mean intensity = 30, range from 1 to 101). Parasitized and non-parasitized fish were similar in condition factor and oxygen consumption rates. Furthermore, the oxygen consumption rate of G. maculatus was not correlated with the abundance of Tylodelphys sp. However, parasitized fish more frequently swam close to the water surface, whereas non-parasitized fish more frequently swam at intermediate depths. When faced with a simulated predator attack, unparasitized fish showed more frequent fleeing behavior as well as a more intense post-fleeing activity. Collectively, these results suggest that Tylodelphys sp. inhabiting the cranial cavity of fish may alter their behavior predisposing them to predation by birds.

Here we investigated in more detail the origin of the major and most widely disseminated SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineage B.1.1.33. We recovered 190 whole viral genomes collected from 13 Brazilian states from February 29 to April 31, 2020 and combined them with other B.1.1 genomes collected globally. Our genomic survey confirms that lineage B.1.1.33 is responsible for a variable fraction of the community viral transmissions in Brazilian states, ranging from 2% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Pernambuco to 80% of those from Rio de Janeiro. We detected a moderate prevalence (5\u201318%) of lineage B.1.1.33 in some South American countries and a very low prevalence (<1%) in North America, Europe, and Oceania. Our study reveals that lineage B.1.1.33 evolved from an ancestral clade, here designated B.1.1.33-like, that carries one of the two B.1.1.33 synapomorphic mutations. The B.1.1.33-like lineage may have been introduced from Europe or arose in Brazil in early February 2020 and a few weeks later gave origin to the lineage B.1.1.33. These SARS-CoV-2 lineages probably circulated during February 2020 and reached all Brazilian regions and multiple countries around the world by mid-March, before the implementation of air travel restrictions in Brazil. Our phylodynamic analysis also indicates that public health interventions were partially effective to control the expansion of lineage B.1.1.33 in Rio de Janeiro because its median effective reproductive number (Re) was drastically reduced by about 66% during March 2020, but failed to bring it to below one. Continuous genomic surveillance of lineage B.1.1.33 might provide valuable information about epidemic dynamics and the effectiveness of public health interventions in some Brazilian states. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Resende, Delatorre, Gr\u00e4f, Mir, Motta, Appolinario, Paix\u00e3o, Mendon\u00e7a, Ogrzewalska, Caetano, Wallau, Docena, Santos, de Almeida Ferreira, Sousa Junior, Silva, Fernandes, Vianna, Souza, Ferro, Nardy, Santos, Riediger, do Carmo Debur, Croda, Oliveira, Abreu, Bello and Siqueira."

In contrast, the equine fossil record shows that an extraordinarily richer diversity existed in the past and provides multiple examples of a highly dynamic evolution punctuated by several waves of explosive radiations and extinctions, cross-continental migrations, and local adaptations. In recent years, genomic technologies have provided new analytical solutions that have enhanced our understanding of equine evolution, including the species radiation within Equus; the extinction dynamics of several lineages; and the domestication history of two individual species, the horse and the donkey. Here, we provide an overview of these recent developments and suggest areas for further research. \u00a9 2021 Annual Reviews Inc.. All rights reserved."

Its incursion into the Americas in the Albian is open to taxonomic debate, as several researchers have hypothesised that the American Sellaea belongs to a new genus. A taxonomic revision with analysis of new material from the Edwards Formation (Texas, USA) coupled with a cladistic analysis using three-taxon analysis allows us to redefine the genus Sellaea. The phylogeny reveals two distinct endemic groups, one belonging to the Mediterranean province, and one to the Caribbean province. However, the involved synapomorphies, related to the left valve posterior cavity, the shell margin, and the outline, are not sufficient to create a new genus. The character related to pallial canals is the only one to be homoplastic in the phylogeny of Sellaea. The presence of canals is therefore a variable character state within the genus. The genus is redefined accordingly, allowing the relocation of several species originally assigned to Caprotina, including species that lack pallial canals and species with unknown right valves. Sellaea minuta is the only species retained over the four Sellaea described from the Americas. The redefined genus Sellaea is Albian-Cenomanian in extent, with the incursion of a single species into North America in the Albian. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Knowledge of archaeological sites of that period in the southern Levant is biased, with most Middle Pleistocene localities in the Mediterranean areas in the north, despite the mosaic of environments that mark the entire region. A key Middle Pleistocene location in the Judean Desert \u2013 on the eastern margin of the Mediterranean zone \u2013 is the site of Oumm Qatafa, excavated in the early 1900s, which yielded a faunal collection spanning an estimated time period of 600\u2013200 kya. Here, we present a revised taxonomy of the macromammalian fauna from the site, discuss the palaeoenvironmental implications of this assemblage, and relate the finds to other Pleistocene sites from the Levant. These data enable a more precise palaeoenvironmental reconstruction which attests to an open landscape, but with the addition of a mesic Mediterranean component close by. In addition, detailed taphonomic observations on butchery marks and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of burnt bone link the fauna for the first time to anthropogenic activities in the cave. \u00a9 2022 The Authors Journal of Quaternary Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The study on archaeal biogeography in biocrusts could provide new insights for its application in environmental restoration. However, only a few studies on assembly processes and co-occurrence patterns of the archaeal community in patchy biocrusts have been reported, especially considering the number of species pools (SPs). Here, we comprehensively collected biocrusts across 3,500 km of northern China. Different successional biocrusts from various regions contain information of local climate and microenvironments, which can shape multiple unique archaeal SPs. The archaeal community differences in the same successional stage exceeded the variations between successional stages, which was due to the fact that the heterogeneous taxa tended to exchange between unknown patches driven by drift. We also comparatively studied the driving forces of community heterogeneity across three to ten SPs, and assembly and co-occurrence patterns were systematically analyzed. The results revealed that the impact of spatial factors on biogeographic patterns was greater than that of environmental and successional factors and that impact decreased with the number of SPs considered. Meanwhile, community heterogeneity at the phylogenetic facet was more sensitive to these driving factors than the taxonomic facet. Subgroups 1 (SG1) and 2 (SG2) of the archaeal communities in biocrusts were dominated by Nitrososphaeraceae and Haloarchaea, respectively. The former distribution pattern was associated with non-salinity-related variables and primarily assembled by drift, whereas the latter was associated with salinity-related variables and primarily assembled by homogeneous selection. Finally, network analysis indicated that the SG1 network had a higher proportion of competition and key taxa than the SG2 network, but the network of SG2 was more complex. Our study suggested that the development of the archaeal community was not consistent with biocrusts succession. The dominant taxa may determine the patterns of community biogeography, assembly, and co-occurrence. Copyright \u00a9 2022 Li, Wei, Yang, Zhang and Hu."

            "text": "Hyperparameter tuning is a critical function necessary for the effective deployment of most machine learning (ML) algorithms. It is used to find the optimal hyperparameter settings of an ML algorithm in order to improve its overall output performance. To this effect, several optimization strategies have been studied for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of many ML algorithms, especially in the absence of model-specific information. However, because most ML training pro-cedures need a significant amount of computational time and memory, it is frequently necessary to build an optimization technique that converges within a small number of fitness evaluations. As a result, a simple deterministic selection genetic algorithm (SDSGA) is proposed in this article. The SDSGA was realized by ensuring that both chromosomes and their accompanying fitness values in the original genetic algorithm are selected in an elitist-like way. We assessed the SDSGA over a variety of mathematical test functions. It was then used to optimize the hyperparameters of two well-known machine learning models, namely, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the random forest (RF) algorithm, with application on the MNIST and UCI classification datasets. The SDSGA\u2019s efficiency was compared to that of the Bayesian Optimization (BO) and three other popular metaheuristic optimization algorithms (MOAs), namely, the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithms. The results obtained re-veal that the SDSGA performed better than the other MOAs in solving 11 of the 17 known benchmark functions considered in our study. While optimizing the hyperparameters of the two ML models, it performed marginally better in terms of accuracy than the other methods while taking less time to compute. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

This characterization has been based on the presence of crops at the archaeological sites and adopting a dichotomic perception of hunter-gatherers and farmers. During the last few decades, the archaeological record has shown a complex and shifting situation both at a spatial and temporal level in relation to the dependence of human groups on this type of resource. Based on a biogeographic model, we evaluated different lines of analysis from the archaeological record to assess the impact of environmental factors on the emergence of agriculture within the region. The results obtained confirm the low importance of agriculture among human groups as well as their flexibility in facing different environmental and demographic scenarios. Finally, we propose that the environmental structure of Patagonia would have played a central role in limiting the spread of domesticated plant use in this region of South America. \u00a9 2022, Chungara.

They are attractive subjects because they predictably emerge in large numbers; have a complex biogeography shaped by both spatial and temporal isolation; and include three largely sympatric, parallel species groups that are, in a sense, evolutionary replicates. Magicicada are also relatively easy to capture and manipulate, and their spectacular, synchronized mass emergences facilitate outreach and citizen science opportunities. Since the last major review, studies of Magicicada have revealed insights into reproductive character displacement and the nature of species boundaries, provided additional examples of allochronic speciation, found evidence for repeated and parallel (but noncontemporaneous) evolution of 13- and 17-year life cycles, quantified the amount and direction of gene flow through time, revealed phylogeographic patterning resulting from paleoclimate change, examined the timing of juvenile development, and created hypotheses for the evolution of life-cycle control and the future effects of climate changeon Magicicada life cycles. New ecological studies have supported and questioned the role of prime numbers in Magicicada ecology and evolution, found bidirectional shifts in population size over generations, quantified the contribution of Magicicada to nutrient flow in forest ecosystems, and examined behavioral and biochemical interactions between Magicicada and their fungal parasites and bacterial endosymbionts.

However, the permanent and temporal loss of forest habitats is a serious threat to their existence and is likely toincrease with climate change. Due to the current threat of losing species, quick actions are needed. Reported here is the biogeography,relative abundance and habitat preferences of fi ve species of RWA in Finland based on citizen science data. Speciesthat occur in the lowlands of the Alps also occur throughout the southern parts of Finland. Only two of the fi ve species, F. aquiloniaYarrow, 1955 and F. lugubris Zetterstedt, 1838, were common throughout the country, including northern Lapland. As their namesuggests, RWAs occur mostly in forests and forest edges, but they also sometimes inhabit open or semi-open yards, mires andmeadows. The most forest-specialist species is F. aquilonia and the least F. rufa Linnaeus, 1761. Surprisingly, the meadow woodant F. pratensis Retzius, 1783 is the second most forest dwelling species, however, its preference for forest edges is clearly higherthan for forest interiors. Based on current data, F. rufa may be the most tolerant of living close to buildings as its relative abundancein yards was much higher than that of the other species. The data obtained on distributions and relative abundances couldbe compared in the future with the results of similar surveys to detect changes in species distributions, relative abundances andhabitat preferences. \u00a9 Institute of Entomology, Biology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice.

The generality of this pattern, while well-established for some taxa, remains unclear for North American trees. To address this issue, I collected published population genetics data for 73 North American tree species and tested whether genetic diversity was associated with latitude or longitude and whether geographic trends were associated with dispersal traits, range, or study characteristics. I found there were no general geographic patterns in genetic diversity and the strength of the geographic gradients was not associated with any species or study characteristics. The northern and western regions of North America tended to have more species with genetic diversity that declined with latitude, but most species had no significant trend. This work shows that North American trees have complex and individualistic patterns of genetic diversity that may negate explanation by any particular dispersal trait or range characteristic. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)."

            "text": "Leaf traits play key roles in plant resource acquisition and ecosystem processes; however, whether the effects of environment and phylogeny on leaf traits differ between herbaceous and woody species remains unclear. To address this, in this study, we collected data for five key leaf traits from 1,819 angiosperm species across 530 sites in China. The leaf traits included specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf area, leaf N concentration, and leaf P concentration, all of which are closely related to trade-offs between resource uptake and leaf construction. We quantified the relative contributions of environment variables and phylogeny to leaf trait variation for all species, as well as for herbaceous and woody species separately. We found that environmental factors explained most of the variation (44.4\u201365.5%) in leaf traits (compared with 3.9\u201323.3% for phylogeny). Climate variability and seasonality variables, in particular, mean temperature of the warmest and coldest seasons of a year (MTWM/MTWQ and MTCM/MTCQ) and mean precipitation in the wettest and driest seasons of a year (MPWM/MPWQ and MPDM/MPDQ), were more important drivers of leaf trait variation than mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Furthermore, the responses of leaf traits to environment variables and phylogeny differed between herbaceous and woody species. Our study demonstrated the different effects of environment variables and phylogeny on leaf traits among different plant growth forms, which is expected to advance the understanding of plant adaptive strategies and trait evolution under different environmental conditions.

Their most common natural hosts are bat and bird species, which are mostly split across four virus genera. Molecular clock analyses of orthocoronaviruses suggested the most recent common ancestor of these viruses might have emerged either around 10,000 years ago or, using models accounting for selection, many millions of years. Here, we reassess the evolutionary history of these viruses. We present time-aware phylogenetic analyses of a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase locus from 123 orthocoronaviruses isolated from birds and bats, including those in New Zealand, which were geographically isolated from other bats around 35 million years ago. We used this age, as well as the age of the avian-mammals split, to calibrate the molecular clocks, under the assumption that these ages are applicable to the analyzed viruses. We found that the time to the most recent ancestor common for all orthocoronaviruses is likely 150 or more million years, supporting clock analyses that account for selection. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc."

Spain represents the southwestern limit of distribution for several types of deciduous forests and, as part of the Mediterranean Basin, it has all the characteristics to be affected by climate change. This study analyses the effects of climate change on habitat suitability and vulnerability in four categories of deciduous forests: Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Leibl., Quercus robur L. and Betula celtiberica Rothm. and Vasc. The approach combines an ensemble platform for species distribution models (SDMs) using three algorithms applied to four global circulation models (GCMs) driven by two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Bioclimatic, biogeographic, soil and topographic variables were taken into consideration as predictors to build 320 single distribution models. Ensemble-forecasting models were then produced for each forest category and RCPs by computing a consensus of single-model projections. The adapted proposal of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was also applied to deal with the uncertainty and notify the likelihood of the outcomes. The results revealed generalized losses in habitat suitability compared to current conditions for all the forest categories, which were more drastic for the RCP 8.5 emission pathway. Exceptions worth noting are forests of Fagus sylvatica (likelihood 25%-50%) and Quercus robur (likelihood 75%-100%) in the Orocantabrian biogeographic subprovince, and Quercus petraea formations in the Cantabrian Atlantic subprovince (likelihood 25%-50%). Betula celtiberica would suffer the largest losses of habitat suitability under the climate change scenarios analysed. The vulnerability analysis confirmed that the deciduous formations least affected by climate change in future will be the Orocantabrian forests, while the Pyrenean and Oroiberian communities are the most vulnerable. The models developed in this study provide decision-makers with basic information and a useful tool for designing plans for the conservation and management of these forests in order to mitigate the impact of climate change. The study also highlights the importance and usefulness of conducting analyses at the biogeographic level, since the effects of climate change may be different and require management and conservation policies at local level. \u00a9 2021"

The use of novel, and transdisciplinary approaches that take advantage of recent advances in spatio-temporal models, \u2018big data\u2019, high performance computing, and fine-scale spatial information can add value to snakebite management by strategically improving our understanding and mitigation capacity of snakebite.

These include streamlined, targeted data collection on snake distributions, snakebites, envenomings, venom composition, health infrastructure, and antivenom accessibility along with fine-scale models of spatio-temporal variation in snakebite risk and incidence, intraspecific venom variation, and environmental change modifying human exposure. These measures could improve and \u2018future-proof\u2019 antivenom production methods, antivenom distribution and stockpiling systems, and human-wildlife conflict management practices, while simultaneously feeding into research on venom evolution, snake taxonomy, ecology, biogeography, and conservation. \u00a9 2021"

There are several known issues regarding generic limits, and the family also displays a number of intriguing long-range disjunctions. Methods: We performed a phylogenomic study using the universal Angiosperms353 probe set for targeted sequence capture. We sampled 37 species covering all genera in the Cunoniaceae, and those in the three closely related families of the crown Oxalidales (Brunelliaceae, Cephalotaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae). We also performed analyses for molecular dating and ancestral area reconstruction. Results: We recovered the topology (Cunoniaceae, (Cephalotaceae, (Brunelliaceae, Elaeocarpaceae))) and a well-resolved genus-level phylogeny of Cunoniaceae with strongly supported clades corresponding to all previously recognized tribes. As previously suspected, the genera Ackama and Weinmannia were recovered as paraphyletic. Australasia was inferred as the likely ancestral area for the family. Conclusions: The current distribution of Cunoniaceae is best explained by long-distance dispersal with a few possible cases of Australasian\u2013American vicariance events. Extinctions may have been important in determining the mostly Oceanian distribution of this family while some genera in the tribe Cunonieae and in New Caledonia have undergone recent bursts of diversification. New generic diagnoses, 80 new combinations, and one new name are provided for a recircumscribed Ackama (including Spiraeopsis), a much smaller Weinmannia (mostly New World), and a resurrected Pterophylla to accommodate Old World taxa previously in Weinmannia. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Traditionally, these evolutionarily diverse organisms have been combined into a single functional group (heterotrophic flagellates), overlooking their organismal differences. Here, we investigated four evolutionarily related species belonging to one cosmopolitan group of uncultured marine picoeukaryotic predators: Marine stramenopiles (MAST)-4 (species A, B, C, and E). Co-occurrence and distribution analyses in the global surface ocean indicated contrasting patterns in MAST-4A and C, suggesting adaptation to different temperatures. We then investigated whether these spatial distribution patterns were mirrored by MAST-4 genomic content using single-cell genomics. Analyses of 69 single cells recovered 66 to 83% of the MAST-4A/B/C/E genomes, which displayed substantial interspecies divergence. MAST-4 genomes were similar in terms of broad gene functional categories, but they differed in enzymes of ecological relevance, such as glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which are part of the food degradation machinery in MAST-4. Interestingly, MAST-4 species featuring a similar GH composition (A and C) coexcluded each other in the surface global ocean, while species with a different set of GHs (B and C) appeared to be able to coexist, suggesting further niche diversification associated with prey digestion. We propose that differential niche adaptation to temperature and prey type has promoted adaptive evolutionary diversification in MAST-4. We show that minute ocean predators from the same phylogenetic group may have different biogeography and genomic content, which needs to be accounted for to better comprehend marine food webs. \u00a9 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

            "text": "Carex section Phacocystis (Cyperaceae) is one of the most diverse and taxonomically complex groups of sedges (between 116 and 147 species), with a worldwide distribution in a wide array of biomes. It has a very complicated taxonomic history, with numerous disagreements among different treatments. We studied the biogeography and niche evolution in a phylogenetic framework to unveil the relative contribution of geographical and ecological drivers to diversification of the group. We used a large species sampling of the section (82% of extant species) to build a phylogeny based on four DNA regions, constrained with a phylogenomic HybSeq tree and dated with six fossil calibrations. Our phylogenetic results recovered section Phacocystis s.s. (core Phacocystis) as sister to section Praelongae. Ancestral area reconstruction points toward the N Pacific as the cradle for the crown diversification of section Phacocystis during the Middle Miocene. Wide distributions were recurrently inferred across deep nodes. Large Northern Hemisphere lineages with geographical congruence were retrieved, pointing toward the importance of allopatric divergence at deep phylogenetic levels, whereas within-area speciation emerges as the predominant pattern at shallow phylogenetic level. The Southern Hemisphere (Neotropics, SW Pacific) was colonized several times from the Northern Hemisphere. The global expansion of Carex section Phacocystis did not entail major ecological changes along the inner branches of the phylogeny. Nevertheless, ecological differentiation seems to gain importance toward recent times. \u00a9 2021 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences"

In this study, nine charophyte populations were collected from different aquatic biotopes across the Egyptian Western-Desert Oases and Sinai Peninsula. All populations were investigated using an integrative polyphasic approach including phylogenetic analyses inferred from the chloroplast-encoded gene (rbcL) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) regions, in parallel with morphotaxonomic assignment, ultrastructure of the oospore walls, and autecology. The specimens identified belonged to the genera Chara, Nitella, and Tolypella, with predominance of the first genus to which five species were assigned though they presented some interesting aberrant taxonomic features: C. aspera, C. contraria, C. globata, C. tomentosa, and C. vulgaris. Based on our integrative study, the globally rare species C. globata was reported for the second time for the whole African continent. The genus Nitella was only represented by N. flagellifera, and based on the available literature, it is a new record for North Africa. Noteworthy, an interesting Tolypella sp., morphologically very similar to T. glomerata, was collected and characterized and finally designated with the working name \u2018Tolypella sp. PBA\u20131704 from a desert, freshwater wetland\u2019, mainly based on its concatenated rbcL+ITS1 phylogenetic position. This study not only improved our understanding on the diversity, biogeography and autecological preferences of charophytes in Egypt, but it also broadened our knowledge on this vulnerable algal group in North Africa, emphasizing the need of more in-depth research work in the future, particularly in the less\u2013impacted desert habitats. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This experimental in situ study investigated fish herbivory in coral reefs of the lower Gulf of Thailand characterized by a considerably low herbivorous fish biomass and diversity, but high live coral and low macroalgal cover. This provided an intriguing situation for macroalgal browsing research. Visual census techniques assessed the abundance of local herbivorous fish species, and filmed single-choice assays using the macroalga Turbinaria evaluated mass-standardized bites (ms-bites) and biomass removal. Multiple-choice assays offering four locally abundant macroalgae identified specific biomass removal and ms-bites to uncover selection and avoidance patterns of observed fish species. The rab-bitfish Siganus virgatus constituted only 39% of herbivore biomass but accounted for 90% of ms-bites. In multiple-choice assays, fishes took most (61%) bites on Sargassum, followed by Padina (28%) and Turbinaria (11%), while Lobophora was avoided. S. virgatus exhibited the most generalized browsing pattern of all species observed. Coinciding with recent studies, our findings suggest that S. virgatus plays a key functional role in reefs characterized by low diversity of herbivores and low functional redundancy. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

            "text": "Aim: Growth rates of organisms are routinely used to summarize physiological performance, but the consequences of local evolutionary history and ecology are largely missed by analyses on wide biogeographical scales. This broad approach has been commonly applied to other physiological parameters across terrestrial and aquatic environments. Here, we examine growth rates of marine bivalves across all biogeographical realms, latitude, and temperature, with analyses to determine regional effects on growth on global scales. Location: Global: marine ecosystems. Time period: 1930\u20132018. Major taxa: Bivalves. Methods: We use a comprehensive data set of bivalve growth parameters (n\u00a0=\u00a0966, 243 species) representing all biogeographical realms to calculate overall growth performances. We use these data with environmental temperature to analyse global patterns in growth, accounting for regional primary productivity and phylogeny using general additive mixed and linear models. The Arrhenius relationship and corresponding activation energies are used to quantify the sensitivity to temperature in each biogeographical realm and province. Results: Our analyses show that bivalve growth demonstrates latitudinal asymmetry and exhibits nonlinear relationships with latitude. We find that overall growth performance is affected by temperature and particulate organic carbon, but the form of these relationships differs with phylogeny. Growth is slower and more sensitive to increasing temperature in the Antarctic than it is in the Arctic, and decreases with increasing temperature in some tropical realms, a previously unidentified and fundamental difference in growth and physiological sensitivity. Main conclusions: Our findings provide compelling evidence that the widely used curvilinear relationship between temperature and growth rates in marine ectotherms is an inappropriate descriptor of thermal sensitivity, because it normalizes regional variations in physiological performance. Without a more detailed assessment of global physiological patterns, the responses of species to local variations associated with climate change will be under-appreciated in global assessments of climate risk, minimizing the effectiveness of management and conservation. \u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

For threatened species, the genetic management of such populations has therefore become a crucial aspect of conservation. Flying foxes (Pteropus spp, Chiroptera) are keystone species with essential roles in pollination and seed dispersal in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Yet many flying fox species are also threatened, having experienced dramatic population declines driven by habitat loss and hunting. The insular Ryukyu flying fox (Pteropus dasymallus) ranges from the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan through Taiwan to the northern Philippines and has undergone precipitous population crashes on several islands in recent decades. To assess the population genetic structure and diversity in P. dasymallus, and its likely causes, we analyzed mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA. Both markers showed significant genetic differentiation among most island populations, with mitochondrial haplotypes showing some mixing across the regions, likely reflecting historical colonization and/or dispersal events. In contrast, microsatellite markers showed an overall pattern of isolation by distance; however, this pattern appeared to be driven by the presence of deep ocean trenches between geographically distant populations. Thus, the current distribution of P. dasymallus and its subspecific diversity appear to have arisen through vicariance coupled with a long history of restricted gene flow across oceanic barriers. We conclude that isolated island subgroups should be managed separately, with efforts directed at reducing further declines in genetic diversity. \u00a9 2021 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation"

However, most of the phylogenetic relationships within Cactaceae major groups remain unclear, largely due to the lack of an appropriate set of molecular markers to resolve its contentious relationships. Here, we explored the genome and transcriptome assemblies available for Cactaceae and identified putative orthologous regions shared among lineages of the subfamily Cactoideae. Then we developed a probe set, named Cactaceae591, targeting both coding and noncoding nuclear regions for representatives from the subfamilies Pereskioideae, Opuntioideae, and Cactoideae. We also sampled inter-and intraspecific variation to evaluate the potential of this panel to be used in phylogeographic studies. We retrieved on average of 547 orthol-ogous regions per sample. Targeting noncoding nuclear regions showed to be crucial to resolving inter-and intraspecific relationships. Cactaceae591 covers 13 orthologous genes shared with the An-giosperms353 kit and two plastid regions largely used in Cactaceae studies, enabling the phylogenies generated by our panel to be integrated with angiosperm and Cactaceae phylogenies, using these sequences. We highlighted the importance of using coalescent-based species tree approaches on the Cactaceae591 dataset to infer accurate phylogenetic trees in the presence of extensive incomplete lineage sorting in this family. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

The high phenotypic diversity in the pet trade, the fact that the provenance of different breeding lines is unknown, and that distinct Eublepharis species are known to hybridize, implies that the continued use of E. macularius as a model requires clarity on the origin of the lineages in the pet trade. We combine multi-locus sequence data and the first range-wide sampling of the genus Eublepharis to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the Eublepharidae and Eublepharis, with an updated time-tree for the Eublepharidae. Our sampling includes five of the six recognized species and additional nominal taxa of uncertain status comprising 43 samples from 34 localities plus 48 pet-trade samples. The Eublepharidae began diversifying in the Cretaceous. Eublepharis split from its sister genera in Africa in the Palaeocene-Eocene, and began diversifying in the Oligocene-Miocene, with late Miocene-Pliocene cladogenesis giving rise to extant species. The current species diversity within this group is moderately underestimated. Our species delimitation suggests 10 species with four potentially unnamed divergent lineages in Iran, India and Pakistan. All 30 individuals of E. macularius that we sampled from the pet trade, which include diverse morphotypes, come from a few shallow E. macularius clades, confirming that lab and pet trade strains are part of a single taxon. One of the wild-caught haplotypes of E. macularius, from near Karachi, Pakistan, is identical to (10) pet-trade samples and all other captive populations are closely related to wild-caught animals from central/southern Pakistan (0.1\u20130.5 % minimum pairwise uncorrected ND2 sequence divergence). \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc."

Studies in model fungi agree on codon usage bias as an adaptation for fine-tuning gene expression levels; however, such knowledge is lacking for most other fungi. Our comparative genomics analysis of over 450 species supports codon usage and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) as coadapted for translation speed and this is most likely a realization of convergent evolution. Rather than drift, phylogenetic reconstruction inferred adaptive radiation as the best explanation for the variation of interspecific codon usage bias. Although the phylogenetic signals for individual codon and tRNAs frequencies are lower than expected by genetic drift, we found remarkable conservation of highly expressed genes being codon optimized for translation by the most abundant tRNAs, especially by inosine-modified tRNAs. As an application, we present a sequence-to-expression neural network that uses codons to reliably predict highly expressed transcripts. The kingdom Fungi, with over a million species, includes many key players in various ecosystems and good targets for biotechnology. Collectively, our results have implications for better understanding the evolutionary success of fungi, as well as informing the biosynthetic manipulation of fungal genes.  \u00a9 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Fifth-generation (5G) empowered internet of things (IoT) edge networks suffer from latency in delay-sensitive applications. To fulfil the low latency requirements of beyond fifth-generation (B5G)-IoT applications and provide quality of service (QoS) to IoT-edge communication, it is important to minimize server delay. Furthermore, 5G-IoT systems consume more power than their predecessors, which is a concern given the growing size of future IoT networks. This research presents a hybrid latency and power-aware approach for B5G-IoT networks (HLPA B5G-IoT) that minimizes latency with minimum overhead on battery-constrained IoT nodes while simultaneously providing a power-efficient solution for B5G-IoT-edge networks. HLPA B5G-IoT has a novel algorithm classifier tool (ACT) for selecting appropriate optimization algorithms based on the characteristics and requirements of B5G-IoT systems. The ACT matrix not only parametrically compares HLPA B5G-IoT with existing approaches but also identifies crucial parameters that enable algorithm selection for load balancing and energy efficiency. In this paper, metaheuristic algorithms, i.e., biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO), are tailored to meet the requirements of load balancing and power efficiency in IoT-edge systems. The proposed load-balancing algorithm reduces latency and improves overall network performance by 33.33%, 27.45%, 23.52%, 21.56%, 13.72%, 11.76%, and 7.84% compared with simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA), ant colony optimization (ACO), bat algorithm (BA), and genetic SA PSO (GSP), respectively. The power-efficiency algorithm consumes 46.6%, 40%, 32.2%, 27.7%, 15.5%, 11.1%, and 6.6% less energy compared with SA, GA, PSO, BFA, ACO, BA, and GSP, respectively.  \u00a9 2013 IEEE."

Although geometric morphometry is a powerful tool to analyze morphological changes, the discovery and identification of these species have long relied on traditional morphometric analysis. In this study, geometric morphometric analyses were used to determine the geometric morphometrics of different species of the genus Ophiomorus in Iran. The Multi Focus technique was used to obtain the best image of the dorsal surface of the head. Two types of Landmarks 1 and 3 were used to obtain geometric information from the scales of the head. To obtain two-dimensional coordinates, landmarks were digitized using tpsDig. For all landmarks, Procrustes Landmark or GPA analysis was performed using PAST software. Also, all landmarks were analyzed by PCA or Principal Components in PAST software based on the variance-covariance matrix between different groups and OTUs. The results showed that the most changes occurred in the head scales of O. persicus and O. maranjabensis. In O. nuchalis populations, an OTU1 was found based on changes in the head scales, being no overlap in the wireframe graph. This population (OTU 1) is distributed in central regions of the Iranian plateau and phylogenetic studies are needed to confirm it as a new species. \u00a9 T\u00dcB\u0130TAK."

This subgenus is distinguished, in part, by its close relationship with Old World Vigna species, but rather than having an Old World Vigna floral asymmetry where distal floral parts can have a right-hand curvature (from a face-view perspective), distal parts of Vigna subg. Lasiospron flowers, like those of American Phaseolinae, curve to the left. Our proposed taxonomy reflects published phylogenetic analyses that resolve the Vigna subg. Lasiospron species in a subclade of the primarily Old World clade of species of Vigna sensu stricto. Vigna subg. Lasiospron is therefore distinctive in having a primarily neotropical distribution. Three of the six Vigna subg. Lasiospron species have an amphi-Atlantic distribution, which we suggest was achieved naturally by the ability of these species to disperse and colonize coastal habitats. Nomenclatural and taxonomic synonyms are reported, along with species descriptions and the biogeographical, genetic, and morphological evidence that argues for each of the six Vigna subg. Lasiospron species fitting a unified species concept. \u00a9 2022 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists."

They suffer from severe habitat alterations due to land-use changes, abandonment, or inappropriate management. The butterflies Chazara briseis (Linnaeus, 1764) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), Polyommatus damon (Denis & Schifferm\u00fcller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), and Polyommatus dorylas (Denis & Schifferm\u00fcller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), specialized inhabitants of these steppe patches, are all swiftly disappearing from Central Europe. We reviewed data on the recent history of their population retractions in the region, including conservation efforts. Using samples from their whole distribution ranges, we sequenced and analyzed COI and wingless genes and together with Species Distribution Modelling reconstructed their biogeographic histories. Populations of C. briseis expanded over the Eurasian steppe biome, where large ungulates maintained extensive grasslands with short open sward. Polyommatus damon became widespread in the steppes during glacial times, and retracted during interglacials, resembling cold-adapted species. It is limited by too dry weather, and it requires disturbed grassland followed by temporal abandonment. Its present genetic structure was induced by the major Pleistocene Mountain glaciations. Polyommatus dorylas prefers an oceanic climate and populated Central Europe from the Balkans during the Holocene. The species depends on disturbed ground. Currently, all three species inhabit only a few remnant sites in Central Europe, and their populations have been further declining in recent years. Targeted conservation actions, including habitat management at remaining sites, ex situ breeding, and (re)introductions, are being taken in Austria, the Czech Republic, and Germany. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

We accepted this challenge for the jellyfish genus Aurelia, which has a long and confusing taxonomic history. We demonstrate that morphological variability in Aurelia medusae overlaps across very distant geographic localities. Even though some morphological features seem responsible for most of the variation, regional geographic patterns of dissimilarities are lacking. This is further emphasized by morphological differences found when comparing lab-cultured Aurelia coerulea medusae with the diagnostic features in its recent redescription. Previous studies have also highlighted the difficulties in distinguishing Aurelia polyps and ephyrae, and their morphological plasticity. Therefore, mostly based on genetic data, we recognize 28 species of Aurelia, of which seven were already described, 10 are formally described herein, four are resurrected and seven remain undescribed. We present diagnostic genetic characters for all species and designate type materials for newly described and some resurrected species. Recognizing moon jellyfish diversity with formal names is vital for conservation efforts and other studies. This work clarifies the practical implications of molecular genetic data as diagnostic characters, and sheds light on the patterns and processes that generate crypsis.  \u00a9 2021 Lawley et al."

            "text": "The ability of bamboo charcoal to reduce the negative effects of high dietary selenium (Se) concentrations was assessed by feeding juvenile blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) one of five Se-rich diets (1.5 mg/kg Se; 36% protein, 8.7% lipid) containing graded levels (0\u20134 g/kg) of bamboo charcoal powder for eight weeks. There were four tanks (350 L) of fish (initial weight 16.0 \u00b1 0.5 g) for each treatment, and the fish were fed to satiation four times each day. At the end of the feeding trial, all of the fish from each tank were weighed to calculate the growth performance. Blood samples were firstly obtained to collect plasma for the biochemical indexes determination. Liver tissues were then collected to determine the antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expression. Dorsal muscles were also collected to determine the nutrient composition. The results show that when the bamboo charcoal content in the Se-rich feed ranged between 0 and 3 g/kg, the weight growth rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) values increased with the higher dietary bamboo charcoal content, and the maximum WGR and SGR values were achieved when the bamboo charcoal content in the Se-rich feed was 2\u20133 g/kg (p < 0.05). The Se content in muscle tissues decreased significantly with the increased bamboo charcoal content (p < 0.05) in the Se-rich feed, which ranged from 0 to 4 g/kg. When the bamboo charcoal content in the Se-rich feed was 2\u20133 g/kg, the levels of glucose (GLU) and albumin (ALB) in plasma reached a maximum (p < 0.05), whereas the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reached a minimum (p < 0.05). Additionally, the activities of catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) when the bamboo charcoal content was 3 g/kg. In contrast, the malondialdehyde (MDA) level increased sharply when the bamboo charcoal content in the Se-rich feed was 1 g/kg, compared to the control group and the groups supplemented with 2\u20133 g/kg bamboo charcoal (p < 0.05). Regarding mRNA-level gene expression, the results show that dietary supplementation with 0 to 3 g/kg of bamboo charcoal increased the expression of keap1 and nrf2, whereas nfkb expression was inhibited (p < 0.05). The mRNA expression of the antioxidant enzymes cat, gpx, and mn-sod was consistently enhanced in the group fed with the 3 g/kg bamboo charcoal diet (p < 0.05). The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf\u03b1 and tgf\u03b2 was inhibited in the groups supplemented with 2\u20133 g/kg bamboo charcoal, whereas the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il10) increased in the bamboo charcoal supplementation groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Generally, supplementation with 2\u20133 g/kg of bamboo charcoal in Se-rich feed improved the growth performance, physiological status, and antioxidant enzyme activities of blunt snout bream. Moreover, bamboo charcoal supplementation in Se-rich diets stimulated the antioxidant system and inhibited the inflammatory response by activating Nrf2-Keap1 and suppressing NF-\u03baB. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

            "text": "Aim: Worldwide distribution patterns of living animals are structured in multiple zoogeographical regions, characterized by faunas with homogeneous composition that are separated by sharp boundaries. These zoogeographical regions can differ depending on the considered animal group, probably because they have distinct characteristics such as dispersal, metabolism, or evolutionary history, and thus divergent responses to major biogeographical drivers, such as tectonic movements, abrupt climate transitions and orographic barriers. Here, we tested if the drivers of biogeographical boundaries are different between vertebrate classes with strongly divergent traits and evolutionary history. Location: Global. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: Amphibians, birds and mammals. Methods: We focused on terrestrial biogeographical boundaries, considering multiple potential drivers: spatial heterogeneity of present-day climate, altitudinal variation, long-term tectonic movements and past climate change (temperature). We used spatially explicit regression models and geographically weighted regressions to select and quantify the factors explaining the position of the biogeographical boundaries between vertebrate classes. Results: For mammals, tectonic movements, abrupt climatic transitions and orographic barriers jointly determined extant biogeographical boundaries, with tectonic movements being the most important. For birds, abrupt climatic transitions played the strongest role, while the effect of orographic barriers was weak. For amphibians, biogeographical boundaries mostly corresponded to areas with abrupt climatic transitions. The strongest transitions of amphibian faunas occur in areas with abrupt shifts of temperature and precipitation regimes. Main conclusions: Our analyses confirmed that different drivers have jointly shaped the global vertebrate biogeographical regions, and highlight that taxa with different features show heterogeneous responses across the globe. Eco-physiological constraints likely increase the importance of spatial heterogeneity of climate, while dispersal limitations magnify the relevance of physical barriers (mountain chains and long-term tectonic instability). Integrating among-taxa heterogeneity into analyses thus provides a more complete view of how different processes determine biodiversity variation across the globe. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Using data on sexual systems and distributions of 68453 angiosperm species, we present the first global maps of sexual system frequencies and evaluate sexual system evolution during the Cenozoic. Frequencies of dioecy and monoecy increase with latitude, while hermaphrodites are more frequent in warm and arid regions. Transitions to dioecy from other states were higher than to hermaphroditism, but transitions away from dioecy increased since the Cenozoic, suggesting that dioecy is not an evolutionary end point. Transitions between hermaphroditism and dioecy increased, while transitions to monoecy decreased with paleo-temperature when paleo-temperature >0\u2103. Our study demonstrates the biogeography of angiosperm sexual systems from a macroecological perspective, and enhances our understanding of plant diversity patterns and their response to climate change. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

            "text": "Understanding the ecological patterns of rhizosphere microbial communities is critical for propelling sustainable agriculture and managing ecosystem functions by exploiting microorganisms. However, this knowledge is still unclear, especially under host-associated large-scale and regarding the comparison between bacteria and fungi. We examined community assembly processes and community characters including environmental thresholds and co-occurrence patterns across the cultivatable area of Panax notoginseng for bacteria and fungi. Both are vital members of the rhizosphere but differ considerably in their life history and dispersal potentiality. Edaphic factors drove the parallel variations of bacterial and fungal communities. Although bacterial and fungal communities exhibited similar biogeographic patterns, the assembly of fungi was more driven by dispersal limitation than selection compared with bacteria. This finding supported the \u2018size-dispersal\u2019 hypothesis. pH and total nitrogen respectively mediated the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping bacterial and fungal communities. In addition, fungal communities exhibited potentially broader environmental thresholds and more modular co-occurrence patterns than bacteria (bacteria: 0.67; fungi: 0.78). These results emphasized the importance of dispersal limitation in structuring rhizosphere microbiota and shaping community features of ecologically distinct microorganisms. This study provides insights into the improved prediction and management of the key functions of rhizosphere microbiota. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Zhang, Wei, Wei, Chen, He, Jiao, Wang, Dong and Chen."

This study aims to explore a three-dimensional planting mode in orchards and provide theoretical basis for the efficient peach-Morchella planting and soil management after Morchella cultivation. Methods. Next-generation sequencing was performed to investigate the variations in soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities and fungal composition under peach-Morchella intercropping for one year and two years, by using the soil without peach-Morchella intercropping as the control group. Results. Peach-Morchella intercropping decreased the soil bulk density, and significantly increased the maximum field capacity, non-capillary porosity and total porosity, organic matter, available potassium and available zinc, which together improved soil structure and soil fertility. Besides, the intercropping mode obviously enhanced soil enzyme activities and mineral absorption and transformation in peach orchard soils. The intercropping also resulted in a decline of soil fungal diversity, and the 2-year soil samples were of higher abundance of Zygomycota. More importantly, peach-Morchella intercropping elevated the yields of both peach and Morchella, bringing about obviously higher economic benefits. Conclusion. Continuous peach-Morchella intercropping improves the soil structure and fertility while decreases soil fungal diversity, which can contribute to greater economic benefits of the peach orchard. Our findings shed new light on the intercropping-fungus-soil relationship, and may facilitate the further development of peach-Morchella intercropping. Copyright 2021 Song et al."

This paper provides identifications for these two species and discusses inter- and intra-species variability considering the available body of morphological and molecular information. We have given one species a new species designation, Tanais adelaidensis n. sp. The other has a 655 nucleotide CO1 sequence matching that of Hexapleomera sasuke Tanabe Kakui, 2019 collected in Japan, also matching a shorter CO1 sequence for a described Zeuxo Templeton, 1840 species from the Eastern Mediterranean. This work underlines the utility and need for detailed morphological and molecular data to resolve the taxonomy and biogeography of fouling and holdfast community tanaids, particularly those that have the demonstrated potential for a history of transport between geographically distant sites."

We studied the geographical origin and phylogenetic relationships of an Afrotropical freshwater snail genus to examine the role of drainage evolution on diversification and range evolution. The relevance of fish provinces in bio-regionalization of invertebrates was explored, as well as the evolution of habitat specificity. Location: Africa including Madagascar. Taxon: Lanistes (Gastropoda: Ampullariidae). Methods: Based on a sampling covering the entire geographical range, we reconstructed a fossil-calibrated multi-locus molecular phylogeny using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches. After applying species delimitation methods, we estimated ancestral areas and habitats and examined rates of diversification through time using lineage through time plots. Results: RAxML and MrBayes analyses resulted in highly congruent topologies and a strongly supported phylogeny. Our BEAST analysis indicate that Lanistes probably originated in the Eocene about 50\u00a0Ma and the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all 23 Lanistes OTUs in our study may have inhabited an area including the Central African and adjacent Lower Guinean biogeographical regions. A steeper increase in species accumulation from the middle Miocene (c. 15 to 10\u00a0Ma), followed by a decrease towards the present was found. Sympatry and jump dispersal were the common cladogenetic events and only a single anagenetic dispersal event was detected. The biogeographical analyses further suggest that Madagascar was colonized from East Africa and that the Zambezi River was colonized at least twice independently. Seven species are confined to rivers and three live exclusively in lakes. The estimation of ancestral habitats suggested that the MRCA of all Lanistes probably evolved in a riverine habitat. Main conclusions: The diversification of Lanistes started in the Eocene and occurred at a constant pace apart from a possible climate-related increase in the Miocene. This study highlights the significance of temporal geographical isolation of river systems and subsequent reconnection in clade diversification and of jump dispersal in range evolution. More comparative analyses across various taxa are needed to obtain a better understanding of African freshwater biodiversity. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

            "text": "Humpback dolphins (Sousa spp.) are obligate shallow-water and resident species, and they typically live in fission\u2013fusion societies composed of small-sized groups with changeable membership. However, we have scant knowledge of their behavioral ecology, starting with potential factors influencing inter-population variability of their group sizes. Here, we compiled a new global dataset of humpback dolphin group sizes based on 150 published records. Our data indicated an inter-specific consistency of group-living strategy among the 4 species in the Sousa genus, as these species preferred living in small-sized groups with a mean size of mostly no more than 10, a minimum size of single individual or small pairs, and a maximum size of several tens or \u2248100. In addition, we clearly showed the geographic variations in group sizes of humpback dolphins at a global scale. We found that the geographic variations in humpback dolphin group sizes were primarily associated with the latitude, sea surface temperature, and abundance. To conclude, our findings provide insights into social dynamics and socioecological trade-offs of humpback dolphins, and help better understand how these resident animals adapted to their shallow-water habitats from the perspectives of biogeography and socioecology. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

            "text": "Aim: With plant biodiversity under global threat, there is an urgent need to monitor the spatial distribution of multiple axes of biodiversity. Remote sensing is a critical tool in this endeavour. One remote sensing approach for detecting biodiversity is based on the hypothesis that the spectral diversity of plant communities is a surrogate of multiple dimensions of biodiversity. We investigated the generality of this \u2018surrogacy\u2019 for spectral, species, functional and phylogenetic diversity across 1,267 plots in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR), a hyper-diverse region comprising several biomes and two adjacent global biodiversity hotspots. Location: The GCFR centred in south-western and western South Africa. Time period: All data were collected between 1978\u20132014. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants within the GCFR. Methods: Spectral diversity was calculated using leaf reflectance spectra (450\u2013950\u00a0nm) and was related to other dimensions of biodiversity via linear models. The accuracy of different spectral diversity metrics was compared using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: We found that a distance-based spectral diversity metric was a robust predictor of species, functional and phylogenetic biodiversity. This result serves as a proof-of-concept that spectral diversity is a potential surrogate of biodiversity across a hyper-diverse biogeographic region. While our results support the generality of spectral diversity as a biodiversity surrogate, we also find that relationships vary between different geographic subregions and biomes, suggesting that differences in broad-scale community composition can affect these relationships. Main conclusions: Spectral diversity was shown to be a robust surrogate of multiple dimensions of biodiversity across biomes and a widely varying biogeographic region. We also extend these surrogacy relationships to ecological redundancy to demonstrate the potential for additional insights into community structure based on spectral reflectance. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Herein, we expand and improve these studies by disentangling the effect of land-use and land-cover (LULC) types (desert, riparian desert, urban, riparian urban, agriculture), vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index\u2014NDVI), climate, and their interactions on avian seasonal variation abundance and richness. Avian community data were collected seasonally (winter and spring) from 2001 to 2016. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and multimodel inference to investigate how environmental predictors explain patterns of avian richness and abundance. Avian abundance and richness oscillated considerably among the years. GLMM indicated that LULC was the most important predictor of avian abundance and richness. Avian abundance was highest in urban riparian and urban LULC types, followed by agriculture. In contrast, avian richness was the highest in riparian environments (urban and desert), followed by agriculture, urban, and desert. NDVI was also strongly related to avian abundance and richness, whereas the effect of temperature and precipitation was moderate. The importance of environmental predictors is, however, dependent on LULC. The importance of LULC, vegetation cover, and climate in influencing the seasonal patterns of avian distribution highlights birds\u2019 sensitivity to changes in land use and cover and temperature. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

            "text": "Background. Among all present demosponges, lithistids represent a polyphyletic group with exceptionally well-preserved fossils dating back to the Cambrian. Knowledge of their recent diversity, particularly in the Tropical Western Atlantic Ocean (TWA) where they are common in deep waters, is scarce making any comparison between present and past major 'lithistid' faunas difficult. In addition, the lack of sufficient molecular and morphological data hamper any predictions on phylogenetic relationships or phylodiversity from this region. The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI, Fort Pierce, Florida) holds the largest collection of TWA lithistid sponges worldwide, however, the majority remain to be taxonomically identified and revised. Principal Findings. In this study we provide sequences of 249 lithistid demosponges using two independent molecular markers (28S rDNA (C1-D2) and cox1 mtDNA). In addition, a morphological documentation of 70 lithistid specimens is provided in the database of the Sponge Barcoding Project (SBP). This integrated dataset represents the largest and most comprehensive of the TWA lithistids to date. The phylogenetic diversity of 'lithistid' demosponges in the Bahamas and Jamaica are high in comparison to other TWA regions; Theonellidae and Corallistidae dominate the fauna, while Neopeltidae and Macandrewiidae are rare. A proposed tetractinellid suborder, one undescribed genus and several undescribed species are recognized and the Pacific 'lithistid' genera, Herengeria and Awhiowhio, are reported from the TWA for the first time. The higher-taxa relationships of desma-bearing tetractinellids are discussed and topics for revision suggested. Conclusion. This first integrative approach ofTWA'lithistid' demosponges contributes to a better understanding of their phylogenetic affinities, diversity and bathymetric distribution patterns within the TWA. As in the Pacific, the TWA 'lithistid' demosponges dominate deep-water habitats. Deeper taxonomic investigations will undoubtedly contribute to a better comparison between present major 'lithistid' faunas and their fossil record in the Mesozoic. \u00a9 2021 PeerJ Inc..

Here, based on an analysis of the stomach and gut (the entire intestine: from the anterior intestine to the cloaca) microbiome in laboratory larva of giant salamanders (Andrias davidianus) under different living water temperatures (5, 15, and 25\u00b0C) at two sample time points (80 and 330 days after the acclimation), we investigated the potential effect of temperature on the gastrointestinal microbiome community. We found the significant Interaction between sampling time and temperature, or type (stomach and gut) on Shannon index in the gastrointestinal microbiome of the giant salamanders. We also found the significant difference in Shannon index among temperature groups within the same sample type (stomach or gut) at each sample time. 10% of variation in microbiome community could be explained by temperature alone in the total samples. Both the stomach and gut microbiomes displayed the highest similarity in the microbiome community (significantly lowest pairwise unweighted Unifrac distance) in the 25-degree group between the two sampling times compared to those in the 5-degree and 15-degree groups. Moreover, the salamanders in the 25\u00b0C treatment showed the highest food intake and body mess compared to that of other temperature treatments. A significant increase in the abundance of Firmicutes in the gastrointestinal microbiome on day 330 with increasing temperatures might be caused by increased host metabolism and food consumption. Therefore, we speculate that the high environmental temperature might indirectly affect both alpha and beta diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiome. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Zhu, Zhu, Zhao, Chen, Zhao, Xu, Chang and Jiang."

Many factors modulate gut ecosystem dynamics during daily life and we are just beginning to realise the therapeutic and prophylactic potential of microbiome-based interventions. These approaches vary in application, goal, and mechanisms of action.

            "text": "Plant functional traits can greatly influence invasion success on islands. However, interrelationships between traits and invasion success are rarely integrated with the island biogeography theory. Here, we explored relations between functional traits and plant distributions to assess which traits are associated with invasion success (i.e. high island occupancy), test whether non-native richness and seed mass of species with distinct growth forms and dispersal modes vary differently with island characteristics (e.g. area, isolation, exposure to ocean-borne disturbances, distance from the nearest urban area, and whether islands were managed for conservation), and whether results differ from native species. We assembled a database of 264 northern New Zealand offshore islands, amalgamating species lists from field surveys and previously published data, and comprising 822 native and 855 non-native species. Non-native graminoids occurred on islands more frequently than forbs and woody species, and long-distance dispersal modes (wind, animal, unspecialized) more than species with short-distance dispersal modes. Most differences among trait categories of non-native species were associated with human-related variables (i.e. distance from the nearest urban area, and whether islands were conservation areas). Non-native plant species with high island occupancy were less commonly associated with human-related variables than non-native species with low island occupancy. Instead, they were more similar in their distributional patterns to native species within the same trait category, suggesting comparable processes regulate both sets of species. Our results illustrate that integrating trait-based approaches in the island biogeography framework can be a useful tool in understanding and predicting plant invasions. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

            "text": "Background Human cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is highly prevalent in the Peruvian jungle, where it affects military forces deployed to fight against drug trafficking and civilian people that migrate from the highland to the lowland jungle for economic activities such as mining, agriculture, construction, and chestnut harvest. We explored the genetic diversity and population structure of 124 L. (V.) braziliensis isolates collected from the highland (Junfn, Cusco, and Ayacucho) and lowland Peruvian jungle (Loreto, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios). All samples were genotyped using Multilocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT) of ten highly polymorphic markers. Principal findings High polymorphism and genetic diversity were found in Peruvian isolates of L. (V.) braziliensis. Most markers are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; this deviation is most likely caused by local inbreeding, as shown by the positive FS values. Linkage Disequilibrium in subpopulations was not strong, suggesting the reproduction was not strictly clonal. Likewise, for the first time, two genetic clusters of this parasite were determined, distributed in both areas of the Peruvian jungle, which suggested a possible recent colonization event of the highland jungle from the lowland jungle. Conclusions L. (V.) braziliensis exhibits considerable genetic diversity with two different clusters in the Peruvian jungle. Migration analysis suggested a colonization event between geographical areas of distribution. Although no human migration was observed at the time of sampling, earlier displacement of humans, reservoirs, or vectors could have been responsible for the parasite spread in both regions. \u00a9 2022, Public Library of Science.

            "text": "Aim: Colonization is a central topic in ecology and one of the cornerstones of island biogeography. Although the evolutionary history of island species is widely studied, the quantification of colonization is particularly challenging because the same area may be colonized multiple times by the same species, whereas initially successful colonization events may eventually be followed by extinction. Nevertheless, an estimation of the actual number of within-archipelago colonization events can be achieved when using adequate sample size and genetic data, which are essential parameters in the inference of colonization success of any species. Location: Canary Islands, Azores and Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Taxon: Buteo galapagoensis, Croton scouleri, Setophaga petechia aureola and Xylocopa darwini (Gal\u00e1pagos); Canarina canariensis, Cistus monspeliensis, Juniperus cedrus and Olea europaea subsp. guanchica (Canary Islands); and Juniperus brevifolia and Picconia azorica (Azores). Methods: The new R package PAICE uses haplotype (from organelle DNA) sharing and haplotype relationships, and controls for sampling effort to estimate the number of within-archipelago colonization events in island-like systems. PAICE applies a sampling-effort correction based on rarefaction curves of field sampling (number of individuals or populations) and genetic sampling (number of DNA variable positions). The number of colonization events for the 10 insular species were estimated with PAICE and results compared with previous methods. Results: PAICE estimates a number of inter-island colonization events up to an order of magnitude greater than previous methods. Furthermore, PAICE can quantify the colonization events of any study species, in multiple biogeographic contexts and considering sampling size, thus providing a standardized estimate of colonization success. Main conclusions: The new package PAICE provides an estimation of the number of inter-island colonization events (regardless of dispersal routes or rates) based on haplotype data across islands. This new tool will allow gaining new insights on the intensity of long-distance-dispersal events, their drivers and consequences for the assembly of insular faunas and floras. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Yet, the mechanisms by which intestinal fungi promote homeostasis remain unclear. We characterized the mycobiota biogeography along the gastrointestinal tract and identified a subset of fungi associated with the intestinal mucosa of mice and humans. Mucosa-associated fungi (MAF) reinforced intestinal epithelial function and protected mice against intestinal injury and bacterial infection. Notably, intestinal colonization with a defined consortium of MAF promoted social behavior in mice. The gut-local effects on barrier function were dependent on IL-22 production by CD4+ T helper cells, whereas the effects on social behavior were mediated through IL-17R-dependent signaling in neurons. Thus, the spatial organization of the gut mycobiota is associated with host-protective immunity and epithelial barrier function and might be a driver of the neuroimmune modulation of mouse behavior through complementary Type 17 immune mechanisms. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc."

            "text": "The Fritillaria is an extremely complicated genus in taxonomy and phylogeny, which contains numerous medicinal species in China. Both traditional characteristic-based taxonomy and universal DNA barcodes (ITS, trnH-psbA, and rbcL) are difficult to effectively identify the species. Here, we generated a large dataset of chloroplast genomes from multiple accessions per species of Fritillaria to evaluate their effectiveness in species discrimination. Moreover, phylogeny of species in China was explored based on the complete chloroplast genomes, and then divergence times of each node were estimated. The results showed that all 21 species in Fritillaria here (including two suspicious species) could be correctly discriminated using cpDNA genomes except F. cirrhosa, which suggested that DNA super-barcode could greatly enhance species discriminatory resolution for complicated genera. Furthermore, four regions (ycf1, matK-trnG-GCC, rpoC1, and matK) gained remarkably higher resolution than that of other plastid regions, but only matK might be suitable to identify Fritillaria species in consideration of its lengths. Phylogenomic analysis showed that the subgenus Fritillaria in China was divided into four major clades with obvious geographic structure. Among them, Clade I, mainly distributed in southwest China, was a young and complicated group. Moreover, according to the analysis, taxonomic treatments of the two suspicious species, namely \u201cF. omeiensis\u201d and \u201cF. hupehensis\u201d in Flora of China (2000) are questionable and might need further revision. Molecular dating revealed that both origin and divergence of subgenus Fritillaria, as well as its four major clades, were significantly associated with geological and climatic fluctuations during the Middle to Late Miocene. This study would enrich case studies of DNA super-barcode and provide new insights on speciation, lineage diversification, and biogeography of the Fritillaria in China.

A new species, Liacarus (Procorynetes) shtanchaevae Arillo and Sub\u00edas sp. nov., is described and compared with the living species of the subgenus Liacarus (Procorynetes). Notes on its biogeography and palaeobiology are provided. It corresponds to the first Cretaceous record of an extant oribatid subgenus and bears witness to the wide range of distribution that the ancient representatives of the subgenus may have had. Most of the oribatid species from Cretaceous ambers belong to living genera, which reflects the high degree of morphological stasis, or bradytely, over the evolutionary history of oribatid mites since the Early Cretaceous. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)"

The Hawaiian Drosophilidae are one such radiation, with nearly 600 described species and substantial morphological and ecological diversification. These species are largely divided into a few major clades, but the relationship between clades remains uncertain. Here, we present new assembled transcriptomes from 12 species across these clades, and use these transcriptomes to resolve the base of the evolutionary radiation. We recover a new hypothesis for the relationship between clades, and demonstrate its support over previously published hypotheses. We then use the evolutionary radiation to explore dynamics of concordance in phylogenetic support, by analyzing the gene and site concordance factors for every possible topological combination of major groups. We show that high bootstrap values mask low evolutionary concordance, and we demonstrate that the most likely topology is distinct from the topology with the highest support across gene trees and from the topology with highest support across sites. We then combine all previously published genetic data for the group to estimate a time-calibrated tree for over 300 species of drosophilids. Finally, we digitize dozens of published Hawaiian Drosophilidae descriptions, and use this to pinpoint probable evolutionary shifts in reproductive ecology as well as body, wing, and egg size. We show that by examining the entire landscape of tree and trait space, we can gain a more complete understanding of how evolutionary dynamics play out across an island radiation.  \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

MaxEnt distribution modeling was used to model distributions. Results for past bioclimatic conditions show that the distribution area of the species expanded and then contracted (LIG to LGM and LGM to HOL). The modelling shows that the distribution range of the species will be narrower in the future. The species will be facing extinction towards 2070. Therefore, the conservation status of the species should be evaluated according to the present findings. Although the largest population of the Q. vulcanica is found in Isparta and Afyonkarahisar Provinces located in Southwestern Turkey, this area will not be suitable for the growth and survival of the species in the future. For this reason, a new nature reserve area should be established in a more suitable climate. \u00a9 2022, Polska Akademia Nauk. All rights reserved."

The three genera Carlana, Parastremma, and Rhoadsia, formerly considered the subfamily Rhoadsiinae, are now included in the subfamily Stethaprioninae. Previous phylogenetic analyses did not include all genera of Rhoadsiinae, specifically Parastremma. Here, we estimated the phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of the genera of Rhoadsiinae (the Rhoadsia clade) relative to the most representative genera of the Characidae. We used six molecular markers from the mitochondrial and nuclear genome to estimate the phylogeny and divergence times. We confirmed the monophyly of the Rhoadsia clade. Furthermore, we estimated that the Central American genus Carlana and the western Colombian genus Parastremma diverged approximately 13 Mya (95% HPD 8.36\u201318.11), consistent with the early-closure estimates of the Isthmus of Panama (~15 Mya). The genus Rhoadsia, endemic to Western Ecuador and Northern Peru, was estimated to originate at around 20 Mya (95% HPD 14.35\u201325.43), consistent with the Andean uplift (~20 Mya). \u00a9 2022, Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia.

Due to such misunderstanding, while F. clara is known to occur across a very large Eurasian range, its actual distribution in the Mediterranean is often scarcely known. The distribution of F. clara and F. rufibarbis in Italy is remarkably obscure since almost all records, which spanned across the whole Italian peninsula and Sardinia, were published between 1834 and 1969, at times when the two species were treated as a single taxon. The few modern records of the species testify the presence of F. rufibarbis in the Alps, and F. clara in the Alps, the Po Plain and Sardinia. Here we present some new distributional data on the two species, extending the geographic range of F. rufibarbis south to the Northern Apennines (225 km) and that of F. clara throughout the Italian Peninsula south to Sicily (900 km). These results significantly change the previous understanding of F. rufibarbis as a widespread species while suggesting F. clara to be a common mountain species through the whole Apennines. Further investigations will be needed to verify whether F. rufibarbis occurs farther south. \u00a9 2022 eScholarship. All rights reserved."

Given the complex life history of A. catenella, which includes benthic sexual cysts, in this study, we examined the potential link between latitude, toxicity, and sexual compatibility. Nine clones isolated from Chilean Patagonia were used in self-and out-crosses in all possible combinations (n = 45). The effect of latitude on toxicity, reproductive success indexes, and cyst production was also determined. Using the toxin profiles for all strains, consisting of C1, C2, GTX4, GTX1, GTX3, and NeoSTX, a latitudinal gradient was determined for their proportions (%) and content per cell (pg cell\u22121 ), with the more toxic strains occurring in the north (\u221240.6\u25e6 S). Reproductive success also showed a latitudinal tendency and was lower in the north. None of the self-crosses yielded resting cysts. Rather, the production of resting cysts was highest in pairings of clones separated by distances of 1000\u20131650 km. Our results contribute to a better understanding of PSP outbreaks in the region and demonstrate the importance of resting cysts in fueling new toxic events. They also provide additional evidence that the introduction of strains from neighboring regions is a cause for concern. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

A total of 316 individuals from the three species, and an additional eight and six individuals of P. argentata and P. pawak were employed in this study. Two genetically divergent lineages each of P. argentata and P. anea (lineages L1 and L2) were respectively detected from the analyses based on mitochondrial cytochrome b gene data. Historical biogeography analysis with a multi-gene dataset revealed that Pennahia species most likely originated in the South China Sea and expanded into the eastern Indian Ocean, East China Sea, and northwestern Pacific Ocean through three separate range expansions. The main diversifications of Pennahia species occurred during Miocene and Pliocene periods, and the occurrences of lineage divergences within P. anea and P. argentata were during the Pleistocene, likely as a consequence of cyclical glaciations. The population expansions that occurred after the sea level rise might be the reason for the population homogeneity observed in P. macrocephalus and most P. anea L2 South China Sea populations. The structure observed between the two populations of P. ovata, and the restricted distributions of P. anea lineage L1 and P. ovata in the eastern Indian Ocean, might have been hampered by the northward flowing ocean current at the Malacca Strait and by the distribution of coral reefs or rocky bottoms. While our results support S. Ekman\u2019s center-of-origin hypothesis taking place in the South China Sea, the Malacca Strait serving as the center of overlap is a supplementary postulation for explaining the present-day high diversity of pennah croakers centered in these waters. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Here we measure the functional diversity of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates in the six terrestrial biogeographic realms and predict their future changes through scenarios mimicking a gradient of extinction risk of threatened species. We show vastly different effects of extinctions on functional diversity between taxonomic groups and realms, ranging from almost no decline to deep functional losses. The Indo-Malay and Palearctic realms are particularly inclined to experience a drastic loss of functional diversity reaching 29 and 31%, respectively. Birds, mammals, and reptiles regionally display a consistent functional diversity loss, while the projected losses of amphibians and freshwater fishes differ across realms. More efficient global conservation policies should consider marked regional losses of functional diversity across the world. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

Therefore, knowledge on their locations and reactions of associated populations and landscapes to climatic changes is crucial for conservation management. We here investigated the biogeography of a butterfly species linked to open forest habitats. Using mitochondrial and nuclear markers in combination with Bayesian simulations, we analyzed the location and age of potential glacial refugia of the species. We identified five putative refugia in Europe. Considering the ecological needs of our study species, tree density within these refugial areas, in contrast to earlier assumptions, must have exceeded the level of individually scattered trees. Our results also provide evidence that especially the refuge areas in the Carpathians were previously underestimated regarding their age: the refugia in the Southern Carpathians presented suitable conditions throughout several glacial cycles, probably since the Mindel or Riss cycles. Additionally, our analyses provided support for a forest refugium near the Tatra Mountains persisting the last glacial maximum. Our results underline the usefulness of this and probably other butterfly species as indicators of forest refugia. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

Defining species is one of the most basic and important issues in biological science because unknown or poorly defined species hamper subsequent studies. Here, we evaluate the species limits and evolutionary history of Tunchiornis ochraceiceps\u2014a widespread forest songbird that occurs in the lowlands of Central America, Choc\u00f3 and Amazonia\u2014using an integrative approach that includes plumage coloration, morphometrics, vocalization and genomic data. The species has a relatively old crown age (~9 Ma) and comprises several lineages with little, if any, evidence of gene flow among them. We propose a taxonomic arrangement composed of four species, three with a plumage coloration diagnosis and one deeply divergent cryptic species. Most of the remaining lineages have variable but unfixed phenotypic characters despite their relatively old origin. This decoupling of genomic and phenotypic differentiation reveals a remarkable case of phenotypic conservatism, possibly due to strict habitat association. Lineages are geographically delimited by the main Amazonian rivers and the Andes, a pattern observed in studies of other understory upland forest Neotropical birds, although phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among populations are idiosyncratic. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc."

This study aimed to investigate whether North American endemics differ geographically from more widespread species and whether differences in climatic niche or traits related to dispersal and establishment differ between endemics and more widespread species. Methods: All available herbarium records of bryophytes from North America north of Mexico (106 collections) were used. Traits related to dispersal were obtained from the literature. Analyses tested whether range sizes and extents differed between endemics and nonendemics, and whether trait differences were associated with endemism. Climate data were used to determine whether differences in niche breadth are present between endemics and nonendemics, and whether suitable climate for endemics occurs outside North America. Results: Nonendemics have range sizes twice as large as endemics and they occur farther north and have greater longitudinal extents. However, they do not have the widest niche breadths and do not differ in spore size (with few exceptions) or sexual condition. Asexual propagules are more prevalent among nonendemics. Climatic models indicate that substantial areas of climate suitable for endemics exist outside of North America. Conclusions: Distributions of endemics and nonendemics are consistent with an important role of glaciation in shaping the North American bryophyte flora. Endemics are not limited to the continent based on a lack of suitable climate elsewhere or by spore size or sexual condition. \u00a9 2021 Botanical Society of America"

            "text": "Myanmar was shaped by the India-Asia collision, fusion of the Burma Terrane (BT) with Asia, and mountain building. Throughout this process new elevational gradients and habitats were formed, which affected the regional climate, but also forged new dispersal routes into Asia and India. In spite of its importance, the vegetation history of Myanmar is poorly known, and this hinders our understanding on the origins and evolution of SE Asian biodiversity. In this study we reconstruct the late Eocene flora in central Myanmar, based on samples from a sedimentary succession in Kalewa, and extend on the Sapotaceae fossil record with additional early Eocene\u2013early Oligocene samples. We then study the morphology, botanical affinity, source ecology and biogeography of selected sporomorphs, and assess the Gondwanan and Laurasian components. Our results show that this late Eocene palynoflora is representative for evergreen forests, typical in a seasonal wet climate, with dryer vegetation away from the area of sedimentation. The abundance of Sapotaceae further suggests that this family became an important component of the SE Asian flora shortly after the India-Asia collision. We conclude that the late Eocene geographic position and Gondwanan origin of Myanmar facilitated floristic exchange between the Indian Plate, BT, mainland and SE Asia, making the BT a crossroads for plant dispersals between Gondwana and Laurasia. The shift from late Eocene seasonal evergreen to present-day moist deciduous forests was likely due to the northward drift of Myanmar, the subsequent two-stage uplift of the Indo-Burman Ranges and posterior Neogene global cooling and drying. \u00a9 2021 The Authors"

            "text": "Understanding the dynamics of species range edges in the modern era is key to addressing fundamental biogeographic questions about abiotic and biotic drivers of species distributions. Range edges are where colonization and extirpation processes unfold, and so these dynamics are also important to understand for effective natural resource management and conservation. However, few studies to date have analyzed time series of range edge positions in the context of climate change, in part because range edges are difficult to detect. We first quantified positions for 165 range edges of marine fishes and invertebrates from three U.S. continental shelf regions using up to five decades of survey data and a spatiotemporal model to account for sampling and measurement variability. We then analyzed whether those range edges maintained their edge thermal niche\u2014the temperatures found at the range edge position\u2014over time. A large majority of range edges (88%) maintained either summer or winter temperature extremes at the range edge over the study period, and most maintained both (76%), although not all of those range edges shifted in space. However, we also found numerous range edges\u2014particularly poleward edges and edges in the region that experienced the most warming\u2014that did not shift at all, shifted further than predicted by temperature alone, or shifted opposite the direction expected, underscoring the multiplicity of factors that drive changes in range edge positions. This study suggests that range edges of temperate marine species have largely maintained the same edge thermal niche during periods of rapid change and provides a blueprint for testing whether and to what degree species range edges track temperature in general. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

            "text": "Further biogeographical studies of parasites are vital to improve our understanding of biodiversity distribution and predict the impacts of global change. Hypersaline lakes are good laboratories to investigate the avian cestode abundance and species diversity given the abundance of hosts (waterbirds and Artemia) and their broad latitudinal distribution. We analysed cestode infection in brine shrimp Artemia franciscana in northern (Atacama) and central Chile and compared them to results from A. persimilis in southern Chile (Patagonia). Thus, we covered a broad latitudinal gradient from 23\u25e6 to 53\u25e6 S. Five cestode taxa including two species of the genus Flamingolepis, Gynandrotaenia stammeri, Eurycestus avoceti, and Fuhrmannolepis averini were recorded from A. franciscana in Atacama lagoons (prevalence = 4.1%). In contrast, no cestode infection was detected in central Chile, likely because they are temporary wetlands. Parasites of flamingos and shorebirds were associated with Atacama lagoons (arid and higher salinity), while Confluaria podicipina and Fimbriarioides sp. (parasites of grebes and ducks, respectively) were dominant in Patagonian lagoons (sub-antarctic and of lower salinity). These differences mirror changes in the relative abundance of the respective final hosts. The flamingo parasite Flamingolepis sp. 1 was the most prevalent and abundant cestode in Atacama, where it was recorded only in autumn. Seasonality and habitat effects (especially abundance and phenology of different bird species) appear to override any latitudinal trends in the prevalence, diversity, and distribution of cestodes. Cestode prevalence was higher in larger wetlands but was not related to the sex of either intermediate host. We recorded a greater taxonomic richness at the cestode family level in Atacama, but a greater dominance of a single family of avian hosts (the flamingos). Ours is the first spatio\u2013temporal study of Artemia cestodes at local and regional scales in the southern hemisphere. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Based on the intraspecific variability of tadpole communities in 18 mountainous streams, the present study quantified the spatial patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity, and the environmental factors underlying the process of spatial distribution and diversity. First, our results illustrated that both elevation and microhabitat features (e.g., water pH, dissolve oxygen, current velocity, chlorophyll a, and ammonium nitrogen) determined tadpole community compositions. Second, the richness of functional entities showed a hump-shape response to the change of elevation. However, no significant relationships were detected between other diversity indices at both taxonomic and functional levels and site elevation. Finally, microhabitat environmental variables were the primary drivers of the taxonomic variation and functional diversity in tadpole communities. However, the relative contribution to the variation of specific diversity indices differed among microhabitat environmental variables. Our results supported the claim that the assembly of montane communities is determined by both spatial processes and environmental filtering. Importantly, tadpole taxonomic and functional diversities were strongly determined by microhabitat features in mountainous streams, providing evidence that microhabitat should be a priority in this study of tadpole diversity conservation. This study suggests that tadpole diversity should be considered in the long-time monitoring of species conservation, as the tadpole is part of the life history in amphibians. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)"

Over 40 islands are still inhabited. Unfortunately the traditional use of medicinal plants was never properly documented there. Our data comes from 343 interviews carried out in 36 islands, including the 15 largest islands of the archipelago. The medicinal plants are mainly used to make herbal infusions or decoctions, occasionally medicinal liqueurs, syrups, compresses, or juices squeezed out of raw plants. We recorded the use of 146 taxa, among them 131 with at least one medicinal purpose and 15 only for tea. The frequency curve of use is relatively steep \u2013 several plants are used very frequently and most are reported only by one or two informants, which can be explained both by the large geographical spread of the area, and even more so by the devolution of local knowledge and disappearance of gathering practices due to specialization in tourism, modernization and depopulation. Most of the gathered plants already occur in ancient and medieval herbals and are a part of the pan-Mediterranean pharmacopoeia. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 \u0141uczaj, Jug-Dujakovi\u0107, Dolina, Jeri\u010devi\u0107 and Vitasovi\u0107-Kosi\u0107."

Owing to interspecific hybridization, infraspecific variation, and apparent weak genetic control of many qualitative characters, which have obscured boundaries between species, the classification and phylogenetic relationships of this genus are unclear. Native Phytolacca is disjunctly distributed in America, eastern Asia, and Africa, and the biogeographic history of the genus remained unresolved. In this study, we used the whole chloroplast genome and three markers (nrDNA, rbcL, and matK) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within Phytolacca, analyze divergence times, and infer biogeographic histories. The phylogenetic results indicate that Phytolacca is monophyletic, which is inconsistent with the infrageneric classification based on morphology. According to the divergence time estimation, Phytolacca began to diversify at approximately 20.30 Ma during the early Miocene. Central America, including Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia, is the center of species diversity. Biogeographical analysis indicated five main dispersal events and Phytolacca originated from Central and South America. Birds may be the primary agents of dispersal because of the fleshy fruiting of Phytolacca. This study extended sampling and added more genetic characteristics to infer the evolutionary history of Phytolacca, providing new insights for resolving the classification and elucidating the dispersal events of Phytolacca.

These classifications are generally based on a combination of remote-sensed proxies of phytoplankton biomass and global climatologies of biogeochemical or physical parameters. However, these approaches are limited in their capacity to account for subsurface variability in these parameters. The deployment of autonomous profiling floats in the Biogeochemical Argo network over the last decade has greatly increased global coverage of subsurface measurements of bio-optical proxies for phytoplankton biomass and physiology. In this study, we used empirical orthogonal function analysis to identify the main components of variability in a global data set of 422 annual time series of Chlorophyll a fluorescence and optical backscatter profiles. Applying cluster analysis to these results, we identified six biomes within the global ocean: two high-latitude biomes capturing summer bloom dynamics in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean and four mid- and low-latitude biomes characterized by variability in the depth and frequency of deep chlorophyll maximum formation. We report the distribution of these biomes along with associated trends in biogeochemical and physicochemical environmental parameters. Our results demonstrate light and nutrients to explain most variability in phytoplankton distributions for all biomes, while highlighting a global inverse relationship between particle stocks in the euphotic zone and transfer efficiency into the mesopelagic zone. In addition to partitioning seasonal variability in vertical phytoplankton distributions at the global scale, our results provide a potentially novel biogeographical classification of the global ocean. \u00a9 2022.

However, the biogeographic pattern and elevational differentiation of sedimentary bacterial diversity have rarely been studied in cross-river systems at a continental scale. This study analyzed the biogeographic patterns and elevational differentiations of the entire, abundant, and rare bacterial (sub) communities as well as the underlying mechanisms across nine rivers that span distinct geographic regions and large elevational gradients in China. We found that bacterial rare and abundant subcommunities shared similar biogeographic patterns and both demonstrated strong distance-decay relationships, despite their distinct community compositions. However, both null model and variation partitioning analysis results showed that while environmental selection governed rare subcommunity assemblies (contribution: 51.9%), dispersal limitation (62.7%) controlled the assembly of abundant subcommunities. The disparity was associated with the broader threshold width of abundant taxa to water temperature and pH variations than rare taxa. Elevation-induced bacterial composition variations were more evident than latitude-induced ones. Some specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs), representing 16.4% of the total sequences, much preferentially and even exclusively lived in high-elevation or low-elevation habitats and demonstrated some adaptations to local conditions. Greater positive: negative link ratios in bacterial co-occurrence networks of low elevations than high elevations (P, 0.05) partly resulted from their harboring higher organic carbon: nitrogen ratios. Together, this study draws a biogeographic picture of sedimentary bacterial communities in a continental-scale riverine system and highlights the importance of incorporating elevation-associated patterns of microbial diversity into riverine microbial ecology studies. IMPORTANCE Bacterial diversity is tightly correlated with the nutrient cycling of river systems. However, previous studies on bacterial diversity are mainly constrained to one single river system, although microbial biogeography and its drivers exhibit strong spatial scale dependence. Moreover, elevational differentiations of bacterial communities across river systems have also rarely been studied. Bacterial rare and abundant subcommunities make distinct contributions to ecosystem functioning, and they share similar biogeographic patterns in some environments but not in others. Therefore, we explored the biogeography of the entire, abundant, and rare (sub)communities in nine rivers that cover a wide space range and large elevational gradient in China. Our results revealed that bacterial rare and abundant subcommunities shared similar biogeographic patterns but their assembly mechanisms were much different in these rivers. Moreover, bacterial communities showed evident differentiations between high elevations and low elevations. These findings will facilitate a better understanding of bacterial diversity features in river systems. Copyright \u00a9 2022 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved."

Here, we addressed this issue by focusing on the evolutionary history of a pan-Amazonian toad genus that has diversified throughout the Neogene (Amazophrynella). Based on a comprehensive spatial and taxonomic sampling (286 samples, all nominal species), we delimited operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from mitochondrial DNA sequences. We delimited 35 OTUs, among which 13 correspond to nominal species, suggesting a vast underestimation of species richness. Next, we inferred time-calibrated phylogenetic relationships among OTUs based on complete mitogenomic data, which confirmed an ancient divergence between two major clades distributed in eastern and western Amazonia, respectively. Ancestral area reconstruction analyses suggest that the Andean foothills and the Brazilian Shield region represent the ancient core areas for their diversification. These two clades, probably isolated from one other by lacustrine ecosystems in western Amazonia during the Miocene, display a pattern of northward and eastward dispersals throughout the MiocenePliocene. Given the ecological association of Amazophrynella with non-flooded forests, our results reinforce the perception that ancient Amazonian landscape changes had a major impact on the diversification of terrestrial vertebrates. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The facilities layout problem (FLP) is a non-deterministic polynomialtime hard problem, which means that the computational time taken to produce solutions increases exponentially with problem size. Metaheuristics are particularly suitable for solving such problems in reasonable time. Biogeographybased optimisation (BBO) is a well-known nature-inspired computing metaheuristic. Its mechanisms mimic an analogy with biogeography which relates to the migration, mutation and geographical distribution of biological organisms. This paper presents a novel BBO optimisation tool that solves the unequal area facilities layout problem to generate multirow solutions that minimise the total material flow distance. Two novel modifications were made to the conventional BBO: the use of a Genetic Algorithm crossover operator in the migration process; and a changed method for selecting candidate solutions. The local search approaches used data on flow intensities and machine adjacencies. Experiments were conducted using five benchmark datasets obtained from the literature. The statistical analysis of the computational results indicated that the proposed mBBOs produced statistically better solutions than the conventional BBO and other metaheuristics for all datasets and converged more rapidly with comparable execution times. \u00a9 2022 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage.

We present a multiproxy approach performed in a sedimentary record from La Molina peat bog, located at 484 m a. s. l. in Puente Viesgo, Cantabria (Latitude: 43.26\u00b0 N; Longitude: 3.97\u00b0 W), that covers the last c. 17,550 years. Analyses were performed on the organic matter, pollen and sedimentary charcoals, which have been used to characterise the fire regime at a local level. The results revealed a steppe-like formation from the basis of the sequence to the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d chronozone, when the spread of woody species is detected. The dry and cold conditions of the Younger Dryas caused the decrease of mesophilous taxa until the onset of the Holocene. From that point onwards, a mixed deciduous formation composed of Betula and deciduous Quercus was established in the region. Besides, a series of biomass pulses was detected during the early Holocene, probably linked to intervals of increased rainfall. Fire episodes detected at the 9.3 and the 8.2 ka events created forest openings and probably favoured the establishment of Corylus, most likely also helped by a climate shift. There was a lack of fire activity until the Neolithic, when the fire signal increased probably linked to grazing and agricultural practices and triggered deeper changes in the Cantabrian plant landscape structure. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

However, recent advances in sequencing, big data analysis, machine learning, and molecular dynamics simulation have renewed the hope and urgency of fnding potential hidden rules of life. There currently exists no framework to develop such synoptic investigations. Some efforts aim to identify unifying rules of life across hierarchical levels of time, space, and biological organization, but not all phenomena occur across all the levels of these hierarchies. Instead of identifying the same parameters and rules across levels, we posit that each level of a temporal and spatial scale and each level of biological organization has unique parameters and rules that may or may not predict outcomes in neighboring levels. We defne this neighborhood, or the set of levels, across which a rule functions as the zone of influence. Here, we introduce the zone of influence framework and explain using three examples: (a) randomness in biology, where we use a Poisson process to describe processes from protein dynamics to DNA mutations to gene expressions, (b) island biogeography, and (c) animal coloration. The zone of in?uence framework may enable researchers to identify which levels are worth investigating for a particular phenomenon and reframe the narrative of searching for a unifying rule of life to the investigation of how, when, and where various rules of life operate.  \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

We performed a parallel assessment of population genetics and demography of two species of pinworms with different degrees of host specificity (Trypanoxyuris multilabiatus, species-specific; and T. minutus, genus-specific) and their host, the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata), based on mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite loci (these only for the host). Given that pinworms and primates have a close co-evolutionary history, covariation in several genetic aspects of their populations is expected. Results: Mitochondrial DNA revealed two genetic clusters (West and East) in both pinworm species and howler monkeys, although population structure and genetic differentiation were stronger in the host, while genetic diversity was higher in pinworms than howler populations. Co-divergence tests showed no congruence between host and parasite phylogenies; nonetheless, a significant correlation was found between both pinworms and A. palliata genetic pairwise distances suggesting that the parasites\u2019 gene flow is mediated by the host dispersal. Moreover, the parasite most infective and the host most susceptible haplotypes were also the most frequent, whereas the less divergent haplotypes tended to be either more infective (for pinworms) or more susceptible (for howlers). Finally, a positive correlation was found between pairwise p-distance of host haplotypes and that of their associated pinworm haplotypes. Conclusion: The genetic configuration of pinworm populations appears to be molded by their own demography and life history traits in conjunction with the biology and evolutionary history of their hosts, including host genetic variation, social interactions, dispersal and biogeography. Similarity in patterns of genetic structure, differentiation and diversity is higher between howler monkeys and T. multilabiatus in comparison with T. minutus, highlighting the role of host-specificity in coevolving processes. Trypanoxyuris minutus exhibits genetic specificity towards the most frequent host haplotype as well as geographic specificity. Results suggest signals of potential local adaptation in pinworms and further support the notion of correlated evolution between pinworms and their primate hosts. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

            "text": "Background: The New Guinean archipelago has been shaped by millions of years of plate tectonic activity combined with long-term fluctuations in climate and sea level. These processes combined with New Guinea\u2019s location at the tectonic junction between the Australian and Pacific plates are inherently linked to the evolution of its rich endemic biota. With the advent of molecular phylogenetics and an increasing amount of geological data, the field of New Guinean biogeography begins to be reinvigorated. Results: We inferred a comprehensive dated molecular phylogeny of endemic diving beetles to test historical hypotheses pertaining to the evolution of the New Guinean biota. We used geospatial analysis techniques to compare our phylogenetic results with a newly developed geological terrane map of New Guinea as well as the altitudinal and geographic range of species (https://arcg.is/189zmz). Our divergence time estimations indicate a crown age (early diversification) for New Guinea Exocelina beetles in the mid-Miocene ca. 17\u00a0Ma, when the New Guinean orogeny was at an early stage. Geographic and geological ancestral state reconstructions suggest an origin of Exocelina ancestors on the eastern part of the New Guinean central range on basement rocks (with a shared affinity with the Australian Plate). Our results do not support the hypothesis of ancestors migrating to the northern margin of the Australian Plate from Pacific terranes that incrementally accreted to New Guinea over time. However, our analyses support to some extent a scenario in which Exocelina ancestors would have been able to colonize back and forth between the amalgamated Australian and Pacific terranes from the Miocene onwards. Our reconstructions also do not support an origin on ultramafic or ophiolite rocks that have been colonized much later in the evolution of the radiation. Macroevolutionary analyses do not support the hypothesis of heterogeneous diversification rates throughout the evolution of this radiation, suggesting instead a continuous slowdown in speciation. Conclusions: Overall, our geospatial analysis approach to investigate the links between the location and evolution of New Guinea\u2019s biota with the underlying geology sheds a new light on the patterns and processes of lineage diversification in this exceedingly diverse region of the planet. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

We tested for such differential island colonization within contemporary angiosperm floras worldwide. We found evidence that AM plants experience a stronger mycorrhizal filter than other mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal (NM) plant species, with decreased proportions of native AM plant species on islands relative to mainlands. This effect intensified with island isolation, particularly for non-endemic plant species. The proportion of endemic AM plant species increased with island isolation, consistent with diversification filling niches left open by the mycorrhizal filter. We further found evidence of humans overcoming the initial mycorrhizal filter. Naturalized floras showed higher proportions of AM plant species than native floras, a pattern that increased with increasing isolation and land-use intensity. This work provides evidence that mycorrhizal fungal symbionts shape plant colonization of islands and subsequent diversification. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."

Today, one-third of their species face extinction, mainly due to anthropogenic threats. Emerging tools in genetics have made major contributions to understanding basic and applied aspects of parrot biology in the wild and in captivity. In this review, we show how genetic methods have transformed the study of parrots by summarising important milestones in the advances of genetics and their implementations in research on parrots. We describe how genetics helped to further knowledge in specific research fields with a wide array of examples from the literature that address the conservation significance of (1) deeper phylogeny and historical biogeography; (2) species-and genus-level systematics and taxonomy; (3) conservation genetics and genomics; (4) behavioural ecology; (5) molecular ecology and landscape genetics; and (6) museomics and historical DNA. Finally, we highlight knowledge gaps to inform future genomic research on parrots. Our review shows that the application of genetic techniques to the study of parrot biology has far-reaching implications for addressing diverse research aims in a highly threatened and charismatic clade of birds. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

            "text": "Climate change plays a large role in driving species range shifts; however, the physical characteristics of an environment can also influence and alter species distributions. In New England salt marshes, the mud fiddler crab Minuca pugnax is expanding its range north of Cape Cod, MA, into the Gulf of Maine (GoM) due to warming waters. The burrowing lifestyle of M. pugnax means sediment compaction in salt marshes may influence the ability of crabs to dig, with more compact soils being resistant to burrowing. Previous studies indicate that salt marshes along the GoM have a higher sediment compaction relative to marshes south of Cape Cod. Physical characteristics of this habitat may be influencing the burrowing performance of M. pugnax and therefore the continuation of their northward range expansion into the GoM. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment to determine if compaction affects the burrowing activity of M. pugnax in historical and range-expanded populations. We manipulated sediment compaction in standardized lab assays and measured crab burrowing performance with individuals collected from Nantucket (NAN, i.e. historical range) and the Plum Island Estuary (PIE, i.e. expanded range). We determined compaction negatively affected burrowing ability in crabs from both sites; however, crabs from PIE have a higher probability of burrowing in higher sediment compactions than NAN crabs. In addition, PIE crabs were more likely to burrow overall. We conclude that site level differences in compaction are likely altering burrowing behavior in the crab's expanded-range territory by way of local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. \u00a9 2021 Inter-Research.

            "text": "The Salas y G\u00f3mez and Nazca ridges are two adjacent seamount chains off the west coast of South America that collectively contain more than 110 seamounts. The ridges support an exceptionally rich diversity of benthic and pelagic communities, with the highest level of endemism found in any marine environment. Despite some historical fishing in the region, the seamounts are relatively pristine and represent an excellent conservation opportunity to protect a global biodiversity hotspot before it is degraded. One obstacle to effective spatial management of the ridges is the scarcity of direct observations in deeper waters throughout the region and an accompanying understanding of the distribution of key taxa. Species distribution models are increasingly used tools to quantify the distributions of species in data-poor environments. Here, we focused on modeling the distribution of demosponges, glass sponges, and stony corals, three foundation taxa that support large assemblages of associated fauna through the creation of complex habitat structures. Models were constructed at a 1 km2 resolution using presence and pseudoabsence data, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, aragonite saturation state, and several measures of seafloor topography. Highly suitable habitat for each taxa was predicted to occur throughout the Salas y G\u00f3mez and Nazca ridges, with the most suitable habitat occurring in small patches on large terrain features such as seamounts, guyots, ridges, and escarpments. Determining the spatial distribution of these three taxa is a critical first step towards supporting the improved spatial management of the region. While the total area of highly suitable habitat was small, our results showed that nearly all of the seamounts in this region provide suitable habitats for deep-water corals and sponges and should therefore be protected from exploitation using the best available conservation measures.

            "text": "The genus Sprattus comprises five species of marine pelagic fishes distributed worldwide in antitropical, temperate waters. Their distribution suggests an ancient origin during a cold period of the earth\u2019s history. In this study, we evaluated this hypothesis and corroborated the non-monophyly of the genus Sprattus, using a phylogenetic approach based on DNA sequences of five mitochondrial genome regions. Sprattus sprattus is more closely related to members of the genus Clupea than to other Sprattus species. We also investigated the historical biogeography of the genus, with the phylogenetic tree showing two well-supported clades corresponding to the species distribution in each hemisphere. Time-calibrated phylogenetic analyses showed that an ancient divergence between Northern and Southern Hemispheres occurred at 55.8 MYBP, followed by a diversification in the Oligocene epoch in the Northern Hemisphere clade (33.8 MYBP) and a more recent diversification in the Southern Hemisphere clade (34.2 MYBP). Historical biogeography analyses indicated that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) likely inhabited the Atlantic Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere. These results suggest that the ancestral population of the MRCA diverged in two populations, one was dispersed to the Northern Hemisphere and the other across the Southern Hemisphere. Given that the Eocene was the warmest epoch since the Paleogene, the ancestral populations would have crossed the tropics through deeper cooler waters, as proposed by the isothermal submergence hypothesis. The non-monophyly confirmed for the genus Sprattus indicates that its systematics should be re-evaluated. \u00a9 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved."

Hot-spring snakes of the genus Thermophis share a distribution restricted to geothermal sites at the Tibetan Plateau (T. baileyi) and in the Hengduan Mountains (T. zhaoermii, T. shangrila). Although the suture zones of these regions are widely covered with hot springs, Thermophis populations are restricted to only a few of these habitats. Here, we use bioclimatic, topographic, and land cover data to model the potential distribution of the genus. Moreover, using logistic regression on field survey data of T. zhaoermii, we test whether hot-spring water parameters and landscape features correlate with the species\u2019 presence or absence. Hot springs with temperatures between 45 and 100\u25e6C and winter precipitation showed the most predictive power. At small scale, our data support the relevance of the hot-spring temperature on the species\u2019 occurrence and indicate that also the along-valley distance from the hot-spring site to the major river might influence the distribution of Thermophis species. Our findings contribute to better understand factors shaping the current distribution of the genus and will aid in setting priorities in applied conservation biology for the hot-spring snakes. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The mosaic is comprised of thicket clumps (bushclumps) scattered in a grassy dwarf shrubland matrix. The bushclumps appear to function as islands, yet their close resemblance to the adjacent Valley Thicket suggests that they could be remnant thicket patches. This study utilised the Island Biogeography Theory to determine the insularity of bushclumps. We specifically tested if they were indeed isolated communities or remnant thicket patches. Linear regression was used to obtain the slopes of the species-area curves, which indicated that the bushclumps, at all three known Calcrete Bontveld sites, were indeed isolated communities. Whilst the bushclumps of Calcrete Bontveld may mirror the appearance of the adjacent Valley Thicket, they are not remnant thicket patches but have rather developed de novo. \u00a9 2021 SAAB"

Little was recorded about their life histories and only a few historical museum specimens exist, including a number of complete eggs from Tasmania and a unique egg from Kangaroo Island. Here, we present a detailed analysis of eggs of dwarf emus, including the first record of an almost complete specimen from King Island. Our results show that despite the reduction in size of all island emus, especially the King Island emu that averaged 44% smaller than mainland birds, the egg remained similar sized in linear measurements, but less in volume and mass, and seemingly had a slightly thinner eggshell. We provide possible reasons why these phenomena occurred.  \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)."

We studied biogeographic patterns of Antarctic freshwater diatoms based on the analysis of species occurrences in a dataset of 439 lakes spread across the Antarctic realm. Highly distinct diatom floras, both in terms of composition and richness, characterize Continental Antarctica, Maritime Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands, with marked biogeographic provincialism in each region. A total of 44% of all species is estimated to be endemic to the Antarctic, and most of them are confined to a single biogeographic region. The level of endemism significantly increases with increasing latitude and geographic isolation. Our results have implications for conservation planning, and suggest that successful dispersal of freshwater diatoms to and within the Antarctic is limited, fostering the evolution of highly endemic diatom floras. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

            "text": "Aedes aegypti is a hematophagous and highly anthropophilic mosquito with a wide dis-tribution, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Ae. aegypti is the main vector of several febrile diseases called arboviruses (dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika viruses), which represent an important public health problem. Populations of this mosquito were nearly eliminated from the Americas in the mid-20th century; however, after the abandonment of control measures, mosquito populations have been recovering territory, have expanded by anthro-pogenic mechanisms, and have been joined by new populations reintroduced from other continents. The objective of this pilot study was to determine the genetic variability of Aedes aegypti collected in four cities located along the so-called logistics corridor of Honduras, which connects the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean. We studied the sequences of two molecular markers: the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI mtDNA) gene and the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2 rDNA) of 40 mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyzes show two separate clades with a low number of nucleotide differences per site, three haplotypes, and low haplotype diversity. These results suggest a low genetic diversity in the populations of Ae. aegypti in Honduras in relation to that reported in other countries of the Central American isthmus. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

The K. pygmaea was individually collected from 2,500, 3,000, 4,000, 4,500, and 5,000 m above sea level (a.s.l.) on the Tibetan Plateau and ensiled for 60 days, respectively. The phyllosphere bacterial diversity increased while fungal diversity decreased along the elevation gradient, and bacterial and fungal richness showed a unimodal distribution with peak abundance at 4,000 and 3,000 m a.s.l., respectively. After 60 days of ensiling, the bacterial and fungal community composition changed but did not exhibit clear altitudinal distribution patterns. All K. pygmaea underwent a weak fermentation indicated by pH above 5.0 and low ratio of lactic/acetic acid (LA/AA). The S5000 and S3000 showed the highest and lowest pH, respectively. Although Lactobacillus dominated S4000 after 60 days of ensiling, S4000 still exhibited poor fermentation quality as well as silages from the other four regions. The higher ammonia N concentrations in S3000 and S4000 than the other silages were consistent with the detectable butyric acid in S3000 and S4000. The silage fermentation of K. pygmaea collected from five regions exhibited poor fermentation quality, thereby inoculating lactic acid bacteria to K. pygmaea before ensiling is highly recommended to improve fermentation quality on the Tibetan Plateau.

To date, there is a lack of information on the diversity and distribution patterns of amphibians in some regions of Bangladesh, particularly the Northwest and Central areas. Thus, to contribute to the present knowledge on amphibians of Bangladesh, we surveyed nine districts from the Northwest and Central regions of Bangladesh between 2017 and 2019 and evaluated the patterns of species richness and habitat preference. Furthermore, we compiled a list of the amphibian species for Bangladesh and summarized the conservation status. The results revealed the presence of 19 amphibian species from the Northwest and Central regions, with range extensions for five species. Diversity analyses showed that the agricultural field had the highest number of species. An updated inventory of the amphibians of Bangladesh shows the presence of at least 62 species belonging to two orders, eight families, and 34 genera. Of the amphibians in Bangladesh, 26.0% are placed under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)-threatened category, 43.0% least concern, 8.0% data deficient, and 23.0% are not accessed by the IUCN. Our study improved knowledge on the diversity and distribution of amphibians in Bangladesh as well as offered recommendations for improved conservation policies. \u00a9 2021 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)"

Located at the crossroad of the mainland and islands of SEA, Peninsular Malaysia is an important piece of puzzle to the map of peopling and migration history in Asia, a question that is of interest to many anthropologists, archeologists, and population geneticists. This review aims to revisit our understanding to the population genetics of the natives from Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo over the past century based on the chronology of the technology advancement: 1) Anthropological and Physical Characterization; 2) Blood Group Markers; 3) Protein Markers; 4) Mitochondrial and Autosomal DNA Markers; and 5) Whole Genome Analysis. Subsequently some missing gaps of the study are identified. In the later part of this review, challenges of studying the population genetics of natives will be elaborated. Finally, we conclude our review by reiterating the importance of unveiling migration history and genetic diversity of the indigenous populations as a steppingstone towards comprehending disease evolution and etiology.

Here, a molecular phylogeny of this genus is presented, which encompasses 29% (= 42; six are included here for the first time) of the species currently recognized. Morphological and phylogenetic support is found for three new species of ground snakes, which are described here based on their unique combination of molecular, meristic, and color pattern characteristics. The name A. arangoi Prado, 1939 is revalidated for a Colombian snake species previously subsumed under A. major Boulenger, 1894 based on new material collected in Ecuador. Reidentifications are provided for Atractus voucher specimens and se-quences deposited in GenBank. With these changes, the number of Atractus reported in Ecuador increases from 27 to 31 species. Finally, attention is given to the importance of using a biogeographical framework that includes molecular data and a comprehensive geographic sampling when proposing species limits in complex taxonomic groups. \u00a9 2022, Pensoft Publishers.

Particularly, across North Africa phenotypically similar and cryptic species can be found, like the west Saharan members of the T. ephippiata complex. However, the taxonomic relationships and phylogeographic patterns of these geckos are not fully understood. Here we show that some specimens of Tarentola geckos from Mauritania and southern Morocco previously identified as T. hoggarensis can actually be assigned to T. panousei, a taxon treated as a synonym until now. Because the corresponding type specimen has apparently been lost, we designate a neotype for T. panousei referring to a suitable specimen from the type locality. Based on a morphological examination of the neotype and comparative material we provide a detailed redescription of T. panousei and evaluation of its diagnostic characters. Moreover, we report on a syntopic occurrence of T. annularis and T. panousei on an isolated acacia tree in the Western Sahara and the (micro) habitat use of both species. \u00a9 2022 Herpetological Association of Africa."

            "text": "The Mediterranean Sea is a miniature ocean divided by the Sicily Strait into two basins with a marked west to east trophic gradient and separated of the nearby eastern Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar. Here, we test the hypothesis that these physical and environmental barriers favor the development of specific prokaryotic assemblages, leading to changes in community structure both in the vertical and horizontal spatial scales. By analyzing taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity using amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of the 16S rRNA gene, we show that there is indeed marked vertical segregation of prokaryotic groups, similar to that found in other areas of the ocean, but also a clear horizontal structuring among the two Mediterranean basins and the adjacent Atlantic waters. Prokaryotic diversity increased with depth and toward the Atlantic, whereas the easternmost stations displayed more phylogenetically diverse phylotypes, despite harboring globally less diverse communities. Basin-indicator taxa (ASVs) accounted for a large fraction of the community (between 50% and 80%) in each of the basins at the surface and bathypelagic layers, being associated with different environmental variables. The existence of biogeographic and environmental barriers in the Mediterranean Sea is likely related to the trophic gradient at the surface and the isolation of water bodies in depth due to the Gibraltar and Sicily straits. Our work highlights the importance of studying microbial regional biogeography and provides the basis for future studies on the impact of this regionalization in the function of Mediterranean Sea prokaryotic communities. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

In this paper, we have conceived a new hybrid Quantum inspired particle swarm optimization and least square (QPSO-LS) framework for real-time estimation of harmonics presented in time-varying noisy power signals. The technique has strong, robust, and reliable search capability with powerful convergence properties. The proposed approach is applied to various test systems at different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels in the presence of uniform and Gaussian noise. The results are presented in terms of precision, computation time, and convergence characteristics. The computation time decreases by 3-5 times as compared to the existing algorithms. The technique is further authenticated by estimating harmonics of real-time current or voltage waveforms, obtained from light emitting diode (LED) lamp and axial flux permanent magnet synchronous generator (AFPMSG). The results demonstrate the superiority of QPSO-LS over other methods such as LS-based genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and biogeography based optimization with recursive LS (BBO-RLS) algorithms, in terms of providing satisfactory solutions with a significant amount of robustness and computation efficiency.  \u00a9 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute."

This article analyses the condition and protection status of European mire ecosystems. The overview is based on the system of European mire regions, representing regional variety and ecosystem biodiversity. We combined peatland distribution data with land cover maps of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service as well as with the World Database on Protected Areas to assess the extent of degraded peatlands and the proportion of peatlands located in protected areas in each European mire region. The total proportion of degraded peatlands in Europe is 25%; within the EU it is 50% (120,000 km2 ). The proportion of degradation clearly increases from north to south, as does the proportion of peatlands located within protected areas. In more than half of Europe\u2019s mire regions, the target of at least 17% of the area located in protected areas is not met with respect to peatlands. Data quality is discussed and the lessons learned from Europe for peatland conservation are presented. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

There are few reports of cyamids occurring in odontocetes from the North Sea, and long-term studies are lacking. Marine mammal health was monitored along the German and Dutch coasts in the past decades, with extensive post mortem investigations conducted. The aim of this study was to analyse archived ectoparasite samples from stranded cetaceans from the North Sea (2010\u20132019), to determine species, prevalence and impact of ectoparasite infection. Ectoparasites were found on two cetacean species \u2013 harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), as the most abundant cetacean species in the North Sea, and on a pilot whale (Globicephala melas), as a rare species here. Prevalence of ectoparasitic crustaceans in cetaceans was low: 7.6% in porpoises stranded in the Netherlands (n = 608) and 1.6% in porpoises stranded in Germany (n = 122). All whale lice infections were found on hosts with skin lesions characterised by ulcerations. Morphological investigations revealed characteristic differences between the cyamid species Isocyamus (I.) delphinii and I. deltobranchium identified. Isocyamus deltobranchium was determined in all infected harbour porpoises. I. delphinii was identified on only the pilot whale. Molecular analyses showed 88% similarity of mDNA COI sequences of I. delphinii with I. deltobranchium supporting them as separate species. Phylogenetic analyses of additional gene loci are required to fully assess the diversity and exchange of whale lice species between geographical regions as well as host specificity. Differing whale lice prevalences in porpoises stranded in the Netherlands and Germany could indicate a difference in severity of skin lesions between these areas. It should be further investigated if more inter- or intraspecific contact, e.g., due to a higher density of porpoises or contact with other cetaceans, or a poorer health status of porpoises in the southern North Sea could explain these differences. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)"

We applied fuzzy set theory and environmental favorability (F) functions to reveal the metapopulational structure of the 222 butterfly species in the Iberian Peninsula. We used the sets of contiguous grid cells with high favorability (F \u2265 0.8), to identify the favorable patches for each species. We superimposed the known occurrence data to reveal the occupied and empty favorable patches, as unoccupied patches are functional in a metapopulation dynamics analysis. We analyzed the connectivity between patches of each metapopulation by focusing on the territory of intermediate and low favorability for the species (F < 0.8). The friction that each cell opposes to the passage of individuals was computed as 1-F. We used the r.cost function of QGIS to calculate the cost of reaching each cell from a favorable patch. The inverse of the cost was computed as connectivity. Only 126 species can be considered to have a metapopulation structure. These metapopulation structures are part of the dark biodiversity of butterflies because their identification is not evident from the observation of the occurrence data but was revealed using favorability functions. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

            "text": "Yellow house bats (Scotophilus) have been known for centuries as a widespread genus of vesper bats in the Indomalayan Region. Despite this, their taxonomic status and phylogeographical patterns remain unclear due to differing criteria employed by early taxonomists and inconsistencies between morphological and molecular assessments. To address these issues, we undertook a comparative phylogeographic analysis of Asian Scotophilus spp. using integrated genetic and morphological analyses of samples collected across the region. These demonstrate that yellow house bats in Asia can be classified into just two widespread species, namely the smaller S.\u00a0kuhlii (e.g., FA\u00a0\u2264\u00a053.1\u00a0mm, GLS\u00a0\u2264\u00a020.18\u00a0mm) and the larger S. heathii (e.g., FA\u00a0\u2265\u00a053.4\u00a0mm, GLS\u00a0\u2265\u00a020.85\u00a0mm), which occur in sympatry in different parts of the Indomalayan Region. Although these two sympatric species share similar eco-ethological preferences, they differ considerably in their geographic distributions and intraspecific variation in mtDNA sequences and morphological traits. These disparities were likely misinterpreted as indicating potential cryptic diversity in previous studies, whereas we suggest they are related to interspecific differences in sex-biased gene flow and phenotypic plasticity to adapt to varying environments. Our study highlights the importance of using multiple datasets to resolve taxonomic uncertainties and reconstruct demographic and phylogeographic histories of sympatric species. \u00a9 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH"

Here, we sampled saliva at 10- to 60-min intervals to track the high-resolution microbiome dynamics during the course of human activities. This dense time series data showed that eating activity markedly perturbed the salivary microbiota, with tongue-specific Campylobacter concisus and Oribacterium sinus and dental plaque-specific Lautropia mirabilis, Rothia aeria, and Neisseria oralis increased after every meal in a temporal order. The observation was reproducible in multiple subjects and across an 11-mo period. The microbiome composition showed significant diurnal oscillation patterns at different taxonomy levels with Prevotella/Alloprevotella increased at night and Bergeyella HMT 206/Haemophilus slowly increased during the daytime. We also identified microbial co-occurring patterns in saliva that are associated with the intricate biogeography of the oral microbiome. Microbial source tracking analysis showed that the contributions of distinct oral niches to the salivary microbiome were dynamically affected by daily activities, reflecting the role of saliva in exchanging microbes with other oral sites. Collectively, our study provides insights into the temporal microbiome variation in saliva and highlights the need to consider daily activities and diurnal factors in design of oral microbiome studies. \u00a9 2022 Hu et al."

            "text": "The genus Porphyra sensu lato (Bangiaceae, Rhodophyta), an important seaweed grown in aquaculture, is the most genetically diverse group of the Class Bangiophyceae, but has poorly understood genetic variability linked to complex evolutionary processes. Genetic studies in the last decades have largely focused on resolving gene phylogenies; however, there is little information on historical population biogeography, structure and gene flow in the Bangiaceae, probably due to their cryptic nature, chimerism and polyploidy, which render analyses challenging. This study aims to understand biogeographic population structure in the two abundant Porphyra species in the Northeast Atlantic: Porphyra dioica (a dioecious annual) and Porphyra linearis (protandrous hermaphroditic winter annual), occupying distinct niches (seasonality and position on the shore). Here, we present a large-scale biogeographic genetic analysis across their distribution in the Northeast Atlantic, using 10 microsatellites and cpDNA as genetic markers and integrating chimerism and polyploidy, including simulations considering alleles derived from different ploidy levels and/or from different genotypes within the chimeric blade. For P. linearis, both markers revealed strong genetic differentiation of north-central eastern Atlantic populations (from Iceland to the Basque region of Northeast Iberia) vs. southern populations (Galicia in Northwest Iberia, and Portugal), with higher genetic diversity in the south vs. a northern homogenous low diversity. For. P. dioica, microsatellite analyses also revealed two genetic regions, but with weaker differentiation, and cpDNA revealed little structure with all the haplotypes mixed across its distribution. The southern cluster in P. linearis also included introgressed individuals with cpDNA from P. dioica and a winter form of P. dioica occurred spatially intermixed with P. linearis. This third entity had a similar morphology and seasonality as P. linearis but genomes (either nuclear or chloroplast) from P. dioica. We hypothesize a northward colonization from southern Europe (where the ancestral populations reside and host most of the gene pool of these species). In P. linearis recently established populations colonized the north resulting in homogeneous low diversity, whereas for P. dioica the signature of this colonization is not as obvious due to hypothetical higher gene flow among populations, possibly linked to its reproductive biology and annual life history.

This species can be cultured under the salinity up to 40 , like a typical marine amoeba. However, it also tolerates freshwater conditions and demonstrates a contractile vacuole in this case. Based on the morphological and SSU rRNA data, this species is most closely related to the previously sequenced marine strain Vannella sp. ED40Ana, isolated from the Ebro River delta on the Spanish coast of the Mediterranean Sea in 2000th. We present here archived morphological data on this strain. Among named species, the strain CY18.4SO.2 is most similar morphologically to V. flabellata, described by F.C. Page in 1974 as Platyamoeba. However, it differs from this species in the presence of pentagonal glycostyles in the cell coat. This is the first case of isolation of an amoeba species which can be cultured under marine conditions from the terrestrial habitat. It suggests that amoebae, showing a wide range of salinity tolerance, may populate terrestrial sites in the proximity of the sea.  \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)."

This polyphasic study represents a new, comprehensive view on the taxonomy, systematics, and biogeography of Codinaea and its relatives. Phylogenetic analyses of three nuclear loci confirmed that Codinaea is polyphyletic. The generic concept was emended; it includes four morphotypes that contribute to its morphological complexity. Ancestral inference showed that the evolution of some traits is correlated and that these traits previously used to delimit taxa at the generic level occur in species that were shown to be congeneric. Five lineages of Codinaea-like fungi were recognized and introduced as new genera: Codinaeella, Nimesporella, Stilbochaeta, Tainosphaeriella, and Xyladelphia. Dual DNA barcoding facilitated identification at the species level. Codinaea and its segregates thrive on decaying plants, rarely occurring as endophytes or plant pathogens. Environmental ITS sequences indicate that they are common in bulk soil. The geographic distribution found using GlobalFungi database was consistent with known data. Most species are distributed in either the Holarctic realm or tropical geographic regions. The ancestral climatic zone was temperate, followed by transitions to the tropics; these fungi evolved primarily in Eurasia and Americas, with subsequent transitions to Africa and Australasia. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

            "text": "The aerodigestive tract (ADT) is the primary portal through which pathogens and other invading microbes enter the body. As the direct interface with the environment, we hypothesize that the ADT microbiota possess biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for antibiotics and other specialized metabolites to compete with both endogenous and exogenous microbes. From 1,214 bacterial genomes, representing 136 genera and 387 species that colonize the ADT, we identified 3,895 BGCs. To determine the distribution of BGCs and bacteria in different ADT sites, we aligned 1,424 metagenomes, from nine different ADT sites, onto the predicted BGCs. We show that alpha diversity varies across the ADT and that each site is associated with distinct bacterial communities and BGCs. We identify specific BGC families enriched in the buccal mucosa, external naris, gingiva, and tongue dorsum despite these sites harboring closely related bacteria. We reveal BGC enrichment patterns indicative of the ecology at each site. For instance, aryl polyene and resorcinol BGCs are enriched in the gingiva and tongue, which are colonized by many anaerobes. In addition, we find that streptococci colonizing the tongue and cheek possess different ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide BGCs. Finally, we highlight bacterial genera with BGCs but are underexplored for specialized metabolism and demonstrate the bioactivity of Actinomyces against other bacteria, including human pathogens. Together, our results demonstrate that specialized metabolism in the ADT is extensive and that by exploring these microbiomes further, we will better understand the ecology and biogeography of this system and identify new bioactive natural products. IMPORTANCE Bacteria produce specialized metabolites to compete with other microbes. Though the biological activities of many specialized metabolites have been determined, our understanding of their ecology is limited, particularly within the human microbiome. As the aerodigestive tract (ADT) faces the external environment, bacteria colonizing this tract must compete both among themselves and with invading microbes, including human pathogens. We analyzed the genomes of ADT bacteria to identify biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for specialized metabolites. We found that the majority of ADT BGCs are uncharacterized and the metabolites they encode are unknown. We mapped the distribution of BGCs across the ADT and determined that each site is associated with its own distinct bacterial community and BGCs. By further characterizing these BGCs, we will inform our understanding of ecology and biogeography across the ADT, and we may uncover new specialized metabolites, including antibiotics.

Besides, a heterogeneous breeding system and the poor veterinary service of susceptible animals compound the existing problems. Here, we propose a forecasting system to define the key points of PPR prevention and aid the countries in saving time, labor, and products to achieve the goal of the global eradication project of PPR. The spatial distribution of PPR was predicted in the THR for the first time using a niche model that was constructed with a combination of eco-geographical, anthropoid, meteorological, and host variables. The transboundary least-cost paths (LCPs) of small ruminants in the THR were also calculated. Our results reveal that the low-elevation area of the THR had a higher PPR risk and was mainly dominated by human variables. The high-elevation area had lower risk and was mainly dominated by natural variables. Eight LCPs representing corridors among India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and China were obtained. This confirmed the potential risk of transboundary communication by relying on PPR contamination on the grasslands for the first time. The predicted potential risk communication between the two livestock systems and landscapes (high and low elevation) might play a role in driving PPR transboundary transmission.

            "text": "The new species, Paroctopus cthulu sp. nov. Leite, Lima, Lima and Haimovici was recorded from shallow coastal waters of south and southeastern Brazil, where most specimens were found sheltered in marine debris. It is a small octopus; adults are less than 35\u00a0mm mantle length (ML) and weight around 15\u00a0g. It has short- to medium-sized arms, enlarged suckers on the arms of both males and females, a relatively large beak (9% ML) and medium to large mature eggs (3.5 to > 9\u00a0mm). The characteristics of hatchlings of two brooding females, some of their anatomical features, and in situ observations of their behavior are a clue to the life history of it and closely related pygmy octopuses. The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis showed that Paroctopus cthulu sp. nov. is grouped in a well-supported clade of Paroctopus Naef, 1923 species, clearly distinct from Octopus joubini Robson, 1929 and Paroctopus mercatoris (Adam, 1937) from the Northwestern Atlantic. The description of this new species, living in habitat altered by humans, debris in shallow water off Brazil, offered an opportunity not only to evaluate the relationship among the small octopuses of the western Atlantic, Caribbean and eastern Pacific, but also their adaptation to the Anthropocene period. \u00a9 2021, Senckenberg Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Naturforschung."

The genus is also well represented in North Africa, extending into tropical, sub-Saharan and southern Africa. Eight native species are recognized in southern Africa, taxonomically placed in two sections: Elisanthe and Silene s.l. Although the taxonomy of the southern African taxa has recently been revised, their phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic history remain unclear. This study aims to infer the phylogenetic position and geographic origins of the southern African taxa. We generated DNA sequences of nuclear and plastid loci from several individuals belonging to all eight species of Silene recognized from southern Africa, and combined our DNA sequences with existing data representing species from major clades (i.e. sections) based on the recently revised Silene infrageneric taxonomy. We used a Bayesian coalescent species tree continuous diffusion approach to co-estimate the species tree and the ancestral areas of representative members of the genus. Our results show that the perennial southern African members of section Elisanthe form a strongly-supported clade with the Eurasian annual S. noctiflora and the Central Asian perennial S. turkestanica. The rest of the perennial species form a strongly-supported clade together with the annual S. aethiopica, which is nested in a larger Mediterranean clade comprising mostly annual species classified in section Silene s.l. Estimates of ancestral areas indicate a late Pleistocene dispersal to southern Africa from central and East Africa for the sub-Saharan members of section Silene s.l. The Elisanthe clade is inferred to have colonized southern Africa through long-distance dispersal from Eurasia during the late Pleistocene. Our findings support the hypothesis of a relatively recent colonization into southern Africa resulting from two independent dispersal events during the Pleistocene. \u00a9 2021 The Authors"

The objective of this study was to better understand the biogeography of activated sludge microbial communities, which are important for the protection of surface water quality. Monthly samples were collected from 20 facilities (25 bioreactors) within 442 km of each other for 1 year. Microbial community composition was characterized by sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Statistically significant distance decay of community similarity was observed in these bioreactors independent of clustering method (operational taxonomic units [OTUs] at 97% similarity, genus-level phylotypes) and community dissimilarity metric (S\u00f8rensen, Bray-Curtis, and weighted Unifrac). Universal colonizers (i.e., detected in all samples) and ubiquitous genus-level phylotypes (i.e., detected in every facility at least once) also exhibited a significant distance decay relationship. Variation partitioning analysis of community composition showed that environmental characteristics (temperature, influent characteristics, etc.) explained more of the variance in community composition than geographic distance did, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity is more important than dispersal limitation as a mechanism for determining microbial community composition. Distance decay relationships also became stronger with increasing distance between facilities. Seasonal variation in community composition was also observed from selected bioreactors, but there was no clear seasonal pattern in the distance decay relationships. \u00a9 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

            "text": "Industrial wastewaters and urban discharges contain complex mixtures of chemicals capable of impacting reproductive performance in freshwater fish, called endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). In Chile, the issue was highlighted by our group beginning over 15 years ago, by analyzing the impacts of pulp and paper mill effluents (PPME) in the Biobio, Itata, and Cruces River basins. All of the rivers studied are important freshwater ecosystems located in the Mediterranean region of Central Chile, each with a unique fish biodiversity. Sequentially, we developed a strategy based on laboratory assays, semicontrolled-field experiments (e.g., caging) and wild fish population assessments to explore the issue of reproductive impacts on both introduced and native fish in Chile. The integration of watershed, field, and laboratory studies was effective at understanding the endocrine responses in Chilean freshwater systems. The studies demonstrated that regardless of the type of treatment, pulp mill effluents can contain compounds capable of impacting endocrine systems. Urban wastewater treatment plant effluents (WWTP) were also investigated using the same integrated strategy. Although not directly compared, PPME and WWTP effluent seem to cause similar estrogenic effects in fish after waterborne exposure, with differing intensities. This body of work underscores the urgent need for further studies on the basic biology of Chilean native fish species, and an improved understanding on reproductive development and variability across Chilean ecosystems. The lack of knowledge of the ontogeny of Chilean fish, especially maturation and sexual development, with an emphasis on associated habitats and landscapes, are impediment factors for their conservation and protection against the threat of EDCs. The assessment of effects on native species in the receiving environment is critical for supporting and designing protective regulations and remediation strategies, and for conserving the unique Chilean fish biodiversity. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Barra, Chiang, Saavedra, Orrego, Servos, Hewitt, McMaster, Bahamonde, Tucca and Munkittrick."

            "text": "Aim: The biogeographic history of the Sahara-Sahel desert is tightly linked to its extreme and fluctuating palaeoclimate and diverse topography. For the mesic species inhabiting the region, coastal areas and the Nile Valley are perceived as the main pathways to disperse through desert habitats, but past connections may have also occurred throughout currently isolated mountain regions. Herein, we test the trans-Sahara mountain corridor hypothesis (i.e., mesic connectivity across Central Sahara highlands) and its role in the diversification of a small terrestrial vertebrate. Location: North Africa and Arabia. Taxon: Acanthodactylus boskianus (Squamata: Lacertidae). Methods: We integrated multi-locus mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies with species\u2019 climate-niche modelling, including palaeo-projections. Genetic analyses aimed to assess the species\u2019 genetic structure, identify its main mitochondrial lineages and nuclear diversity, and reconstruct its ancestral biogeography. Species\u2019 climate-niche stability was modelled independently for the Late Pleistocene-Holocene and the Plio-Pleistocene, to infer historical climatic refugia and dispersal corridors. Results: Four spatially structured mitochondrial lineages, integrating several parapatric sub-lineages, originated during the Plio-Pleistocene. Nuclear data revealed nine potential candidate species. Climatic refugia were located in mountains and desert fringes, remaining consistent for the Late Pleistocene-Holocene and the Plio-Pleistocene. Recurrent North-South climatic corridors were located along the desert periphery, while others less frequent were found across Central Sahara. Ancestral biogeography analyses recovered a recent Pleistocene colonization of the Sahel throughout eastern Sahara and either Sahara or Sahel origin for Central Sahara populations. Main conclusions: Species\u2019 diversification was triggered by a combination of Plio-Pleistocene climatic cycles across a complex topographic region, where mountains acted as the main diversification hotspots. The historical role of Central Sahara highlands as main non-peripheral mesic refugia was corroborated. In addition, intermittent climatic connections linked Mediterranean and Sahel ecoregions with Central Sahara refugia, suggesting the existence of alternative trans-Sahara dispersal routes to the putative coastal and Nile corridors. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

It includes 192 entries accounting for 68 named and 47 unnamed species belonging to 73 genera and 58 families of non-astigmatid oribatid mites. Specimens from the brachypyline supercohort were dominant (54.7%), followed by Mixonomata (30.7%). However, current knowledge is far from being complete and distribution patterns show large gaps throughout the country due to this lacking knowledge and most existing investigations only include group specific studies that prevent from any conclusions regarding the real community composition of oribatids in Colombia. From 32 political-administrative departments, oribatids have been reported in 20, but 5 account for 65% of the records. These are: Cundinamarca -including Bogot\u00e1 D.C.- (24.4%), Magdalena (21.8%), Nari\u00f1o (6.3%), La Guajira (6.3%), and Quind\u00edo (5.9%). Whereas most oribatid reports in the Neotropical region have taken place during the past five decades, a map presented in this document shows that Colombia still lags behind other Latin American countries. Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, for instance, have reported the highest number of species for the region and are the only nations that possess national oribatid checklists in Latin America. The current work represents a national baseline of oribatids encouraging further study of this clearly underrepresented group.  \u00a9 2022 Magnolia Press."

            "text": "During the third millennium BC, Mesopotamia (the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, in modern Iraq-Syria), was dominated by the world\u2019s earliest cities and states, which were ruled by powerful elites. Ur, in present-day southern Iraq, was one of the largest and most important of these cities, and irrigation-based agriculture and large herds of domesticated animals were the twin mainstays of the economy and diet. Texts suggest that the societies of the Mesopotamian city-states were extremely hierarchical and underpinned by institutionalised and heavily-managed farming systems. Prevailing narratives suggest that the animal management strategies within these farming systems in the third millennium BC were homogenous. There have been few systematic science-based studies of human and animal diets, mobility, or other forms of human-animal interaction in Mesopotamia, but such approaches can inform understanding of past economies, including animal management, social hierarchies, diet and migration. Oxygen, carbon and strontium isotopic analysis of animal tooth enamel from both royal and private/non-royal burial contexts at Early Dynastic Ur (2900\u20132350 BC) indicate that a variety of herd management strategies and habitats were exploited. These data also suggest that there is no correlation between animal-management practices and the cattle found in royal or private/non-royal burial contexts. The results demonstrate considerable divergence between agro-pastoral models promoted by the state and the realities of day-to-day management practices. The data from Ur suggest that the animals exploited different plant and water sources, and that animals reared in similar ways ended up in different depositional contexts.

            "text": "Background: In Tanzania, the uptake of optimal doses (\u2265 3) of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria (IPTp-SP) during pregnancy has remained below the recommended target of 80%. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the predictors for the uptake of optimal IPTp-SP among pregnant women in Tanzania. Methods: This study used data from the 2015\u201316 Tanzania demographic and health survey and malaria indicator survey (TDHS-MIS). The study had a total of 4111 women aged 15 to 49 who had live births 2\u00a0years preceding the survey. The outcome variable was uptake of three or more doses of IPTp-SP, and the independent variables were age, marital status, education level, place of residence, wealth index, occupation, geographic zone, parity, the timing of first antenatal care (ANC), number of ANC visits and type of the health facility for ANC visits. Predictors for the optimal uptake of IPTp-SP were assessed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 327 (8%) women had optimal uptake of IPTp-SP doses. Among the assessed predictors, the following were significantly associated with optimal uptake of IPTp-SP doses; education level [primary (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI 1.26\u20133.67); secondary or higher education (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI 1.08\u20134.22)], attended ANC at the first trimester (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.20\u20134.96), attended \u2265 4 ANC visits (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI 1.34\u20132.83), attended government health facilities (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.97) and geographic zone [Central (AOR: 5, 95% CI 2.08\u201311.95); Southern Highlands (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI 1.15\u20137.02); Southwest Highlands (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI 1.03\u20137.29); Lake (AOR: 3.5, 95% CI 1.51\u20138.14); Eastern (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI 1.88\u201311.07)]. Conclusions: The uptake of optimal IPTp-SP doses is still low in Tanzania. The optimal uptake of IPTp-SP was associated with attending ANC in the first trimester, attending more than four ANC visits, attending government health facility for ANC, having primary, secondary, or higher education level, and geographic zone. Therefore, there is a need for health education and behavior change interventions with an emphasis on the optimal use of IPTp-SP doses. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s)."
