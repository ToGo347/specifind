            "text": "Soilborne pathogens affect agricultural productivity and soil functions, yet the specific impacts of pathogen infections on the soil and plant root-associated microbiomes, the key determinants of plant health, remain unclear. Filling this knowledge gap is required to understanding microbial ecological responses, and to developing biological tools to manage and predict the prevalence and severity of soilborne diseases, which can improve soil health, and plant yield. We hypothesized that soilborne pathogens impact the diversity, function, and ecological interactions in soil microbiomes and form a pathobiome. To test the hypothesis, we conducted field sampling in 35 cotton fields in Australia and collected a total of 560 soil samples, which included samples from the rhizosphere (the area in close contact with the roots) and bulk soils. We aimed to investigate how soil microbiomes and key soil properties respond to Verticillium wilt (VW) of cotton, which is caused by the soilborne pathogen Verticillium dahliae. We found that the presence of the pathogen altered the microbiome structure in both bulk and rhizosphere soils. Notably, healthy soils exhibited more complex microbial networks than diseased soils. Furthermore, a putative pathobiome consisting of various microbial taxa that could influence pathogen infection was identified. Specific pathobiome taxa, such as Gibellulopsis spp., displayed a positive association with V. dahliae. In contrast, known biocontrol agents (BCAs) such as Bacillus spp., Fusarium spp., and Talaromyces spp., were negatively correlated with pathogen abundance. After isolation, pathobiome BCA members demonstrated strong biocontrol activity against V. dahliae in vitro, indicating their potential for enhancing resistance to pathogen invasion in agricultural soils. Moreover, shotgun sequencing analysis revealed a gene encoding beta-glucosidase as a putative indicator of soil health. Structural Equation Modelling showed that VW disease incidence is significantly influenced by several factors, including the relative abundance of V. dahliae, the pathobiome, and various abiotic factors such as precipitation, soil moisture, and pH. Taken together, our findings offer novel field evidence for the key biotic and abiotic drivers of a soilborne pathogen. This knowledge could facilitate the development of biological tools to control soilborne diseases and predict soil health and disease incidence, thus providing innovative strategies for sustainable agricultural disease management. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

The crop landscape is influenced by farmers through different field practices, and further impacts the variations of soil temperature, soil moisture, and field microclimate. To examine how different management strategies affect the dynamics of canopy and soil parameters (canopy temperature, soil temperature and soil moisture) and the aforementioned interaction, two observation systems were installed in an organic-certified (ORG) tea field and a conventional (CONV) tea field in northern Taiwan. Due to the application of different field practices, the leaf area in ORG is higher. The results show that the diurnal range of canopy temperature in CONV was larger than that in ORG (7.52 \u00b0C vs 5.97 \u00b0C). However, the daily loss rate of soil water content in ORG was two times faster than that in CONV (0.97% d\u22121 vs. 0.45% d\u22121). The outcomes imply that the organic practices in this study lead to higher evapotranspiration and milder variation in temperature on the canopy scale. These findings suggest that the application of organic practice could help to mitigate the changes of microclimate in tea field. In addition, the adoption of appropriate management strategies could assist farmers in adapting to environmental fluctuations and provide quantitative references of microclimate in tea field under different agricultural applications and climatic conditions. \u00a9 2023"

However, industrial-scale production remains challenging and several parameters significantly influencing the application of the technology need to be finely tuned. In the present study, an evaluation of the production of biohydrogen from cassava and pineapple waste, widely available in many African countries, was carried out using different microbial consortia originating from industrial biogas plants in Italy. The production of biohydrogen was defined both by screening the most appropriate inoculum and by using a \u201ccentered composite design\u201d to optimize the inoculum pretreatment time and the pH. From cassava waste, which is abundant of starch (43%), the highest hydrogen levels (62.32 mL H2/gVS) were obtained at pH 7.72 adopting a 4-h heat treated inoculum originating from an anaerobic digester fed with corn and barley silage. Higher hydrogen yields (75.50 mL H2/gVS) were achieved at pH 6 once pineapple, which has a high content of hemicellulose, was converted by another selected inoculum, isolated from an olive pomace treating plant, where hemicellulose is one of the most common polysaccharide. The correlation coefficients R2 and adjusted R2 are close to unity, proving the model to be appropriate to express the concentration of hydrogen produced. This combined approach performed successfully and represents a strong strategy to optimize the production of biohydrogen from agricultural residues even in African contexts. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of water stress (WS) at different growth stages on maize plant development, root morphology, water utilization, hormone signaling and N accumulation under various N conditions. A set of controlled drought stress at 60% field capacity was conducted from bell (V12) to tassel (VT) stage (V12-VT, denoted as W1W2), from silk (R1) to milk (R3) stage (R1-R3, denoted as W2W1) and their compound stages (V12-R3, denoted as W1W1) under high- and low-N supply, respectively. The results indicated that compared to the well-watered control (W2W2), W2W1 reduced root length, root area, and shoot dry matter by 4.68\u201319.15%, 5.92\u201311.97% and 4.38\u201329.61%, respectively, while W1W2 promoted the root system and improved the shoot growth, grain formation and plant water use efficiency (WUEp). High N supply tended to aggravate WS with a poorer root system and lower leaf water potential (\u03c8leaf) but higher leaf abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation at different growth stages. Leaf ABA significantly increased while stomatal conductance (Gs) decreased under WS and N-rich environment, hence increasing leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi). Root zeatin-riboside (ZR) was higher for well-watered and N-rich conditions. Moreover, leaf ABA significantly increased with the decrease of \u03c8leaf (R2 =0.51 for R3, R2 =0.35 for dough stage (R4)) and the variation of \u03c8leaf was relatively constant (\u22640.3 MPa) with different water treatments, indicating that maize performed isohydric behavior to response water stress and N-rich environment. This study suggests that to promote the potential of water- and N-saving and improve crop productivity in maize cultivation, mild water stress at vegetative growth stages and appropriate N supply are of great importance. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

This study presents a comparative analysis of root, soil, and liquid water (precipitation, dew, and groundwater) samples obtained from a desert steppe using isotope ratio infrared spectrometry (IRIS) and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The objective was to evaluate the applicability of these techniques in discerning the water sources of Stipa breviflora, a shallow-rooted herbaceous plant species. Additionally, we explored the root water uptake characteristics and water use strategy of S. breviflora. Our findings indicate that the IRIS method had more enriched values of D compared to the IRMS method across all samples, while no discernible pattern was observed for 18O. Notably, the differences observed among all samples exceeded the instruments' accuracies. Moreover, an unexpected occurrence was noted, whereby both D and 18O values in the root water were more enriched than in any of the considered water sources, rendering identification of the plant water sources unattainable. By conducting a re-analysis of more refined soil layer samples, we discovered that S. breviflora exhibits the ability to absorb and utilize water sources in close proximity to the soil surface. It further suggested that the shallow-rooted herbaceous plants in desert steppes can exploit small rainfalls, frequently overlooked in their ecological importance. Considering the distinctive soil and plant characteristics of desert steppes, we recommend adopting IRMS methods in conjunction with refined surface soil sampling for isotopic analysis aiming to identify water sources of shallow-rooted herbaceous plants. This study provides novel insights into assessing the suitability of isotopic techniques for analyzing plant water sources, while enhancing our understanding of water use strategies and environmental adaptation mechanisms employed by shallow-rooted herbaceous plants within xerophytic grassland ecosystems. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

This study evaluated the use of green compost at increasing rates (10, 25 and 50% v/v) for the revegetation of extremely acidic sulfidic tailings of the North Mathiatis mine, Cyprus, with the use of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plants, under greenhouse conditions. Alfalfa seeds were successfully germinated in tailings amended either with 25% or 50% (v/v) compost (52 and 85%, respectively). Plants managed to complete their life cycle and produce seeds only in the tailings amended with 50% (v/v) compost, since plants grown in tailings amended with lower rates of compost (i.e., 10 or 25% v/v) showed severe symptoms of phytotoxicity and eventually died. The amendment of tailings with 50% (v/v) green compost resulted in increased pH values, water holding capacity and organic content levels, soil respiration rates, as well as changes in soil elemental composition compared with tailings alone treatment, which in turn facilitated the growth and development of alfalfa plants during the whole experimental period (140 days). Plants managed to reach the late seedpod growth stage, indicating their potential regeneration and continual existence to the amended tailings, simultaneously uncovering the development of favorable conditions in the rhizosphere for the successful revegetation of studied tailings. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

The release of P in recycled materials can be enhanced with organic acids produced from cellulose. In this study, fertilisers based on sewage sludge (SS) and poultry manure (BR) were treated with increasing levels (0 %, 8 %, and 20 %) of hydroxy carboxylic and carboxylic acid mixture to determine the effect of acidification on the availability of P and other selected elements. According to sequential extractions, acidification increased the share of labile P in both products. In SS, which was dominated by refractory metal phosphates, a higher acid dose was required for the effect, and a smaller share of total P was transformed than in the BR, which was already rich in easily accessible P. Besides P, acidification increased the mobility of several elements but induced no harmful element accumulation in ryegrass leaves. The increased P lability recorded by fractionation in SS was reflected in ryegrass P uptake, cumulative yield, apparent P recovery, and mineral-P equivalence. In BR exhibiting superiority to mineral P, the effect of acidification on plant growth and P uptake was negative. Acidification treatment offers an option to enhance the plant availability of circular P, but the treatment needs to be tailored according to product characteristics. Optimising the application rate and acid composition might allow increasing effectiveness while avoiding negative growth effects. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

Flavonoid glycosides are the main bioactive components in safflower, but only a few UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGT) have been identified. Three differentially expressed UGT genes related with the accumulation of 9 flavonoid O-glycosides were screened from metabolomics and transcriptome analysis. Safflower corolla protoplasts were used to confirm the glycosylation ability of UGT candidates in vivo for the first time. The astragalin content was significantly increased only when CtUGT3 was overexpressed. CtUGT3 also showed flavonoid 3-OH and 7-OH glycosylation activities in vitro. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that G15, T136, S276, and E384 were critical catalytic residues for the glycosylation ability of CtUGT3. These results demonstrate that CtUGT3 has a flavonoid 3-OH glycosylation function and is involved in the biosynthesis of astragalin in safflower.

Gene-based KASP markers were developed for putative candidate genes TaIPK1-2D and TaNAS10-6D. Abstract: Micronutrient malnutrition is one of the most common public health problems in the world. Biofortification, the most attractive and sustainable solution to surmount malnutrition requires the development of micronutrient enriched new crop cultivars. In this study, two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, ZM175/XY60 and ZM175/LX987, were used to identify QTL for grain zinc concentration (GZnC), grain iron concentration (GFeC) and thousand grain weight (TGW). Eight QTL for GZnC, six QTL for GFeC and five QTL for TGW were detected. Three QTL on chromosomes 2DL and 4BS and chromosome 6A showed pleiotropic effects on all three traits. The 4BS and 6A QTL also increased plant height and might be Rht-B1a and Rht25a, respectively. The 2DL locus within a suppressed recombination region was identified in both RIL populations and the favorable allele simultaneously increasing GZnC, GFeC and TGW was contributed by XY60 and LX987. A QTL on chromosome 6DL associated only with GZnC was detected in ZM175/XY60 and was validated in JD8/AK58 RILs using kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) marker K_AX-110119937. Both the 2DL and 6DL QTL were new loci for GZnC. Based on gene annotations, sequence variations and expression profiles, the\u00a0phytic acid biosynthesis gene TaIPK1-2D and nicotianamine synthase gene TaNAS10-6D were predicted as candidate genes. Their gene-based KASP markers were developed and validated in a cultivar panel of 343 wheat accessions. This study investigated the genetic basis of GZnC and GFeC and provided valuable candidate genes and markers for breeding Zn- and Fe-enriched wheat. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

            "text": "Soybeans are rich in high-quality protein and raw materials for producing hundreds of chemical products. Consequently, soybean cultivation has gained widespread prevalence across diverse geographic regions. Soybean breeding necessitates the development of early-, standard-, and late-maturing cultivars to accommodate cultivation at various latitudes, thereby optimizing the utilization of solar radiation. In the practical process of determining the maturity of soybean breeding materials within the breeding field, the ripeness is assessed based on three critical criteria: pod moisture content, leaf color, and the degree of leaf shedding. These parameters reflect the crown structure, physicochemical parameters, and reproductive organ changes in soybeans during the maturation process. Therefore, methods for analyzing soybean maturity at the breeding plot scale should match the standards of agricultural experts to the maximum possible extent. This study presents a hyperspectral remote sensing approach for monitoring soybean maturity. We collected five periods of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based soybean canopy hyperspectral digital orthophoto maps (DOMs) and ground-level measurements of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), flavonoids (Flav), and the nitrogen balance index (NBI) from a breeding farm. This study explores the following aspects: (1) the correlations between soybean LCC, NBI, Flav, and maturity; (2) the estimation of soybean LCC, NBI, and Flav using Gaussian process regression (GPR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF) regression techniques; and (3) the application of threshold-based methods in conjunction with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)+LCC and NDVI+NBI for soybean maturity monitoring. The results of this study indicate the following: (1) Soybean LCC, NBI, and Flav are associated with maturity. LCC increases during the beginning bloom period (P1) to the beginning seed period (P3) and sharply decreases during the beginning maturity period (P4) stage. Flav continues to increase from P1 to P4. NBI remains relatively consistent from P1 to P3 and then drops rapidly during the P4 stage. (2) The GPR, PLSR, and RF methodologies yield comparable accuracy in estimating soybean LCC (coefficient of determination (R2): 0.737\u20130.832, root mean square error (RMSE): 3.35\u20134.202 Dualex readings), Flav (R2: 0.321\u20130.461, RMSE: 0.13\u20130.145 Dualex readings), and NBI (R2: 0.758\u20130.797, RMSE: 2.922\u20133.229 Dualex readings). (3) The combination of the threshold method with NDVI < 0.55 and NBI < 8.2 achieves the highest classification accuracy (accuracy = 0.934). Further experiments should explore the relationships between crop NDVI, the Chlorophyll Index, LCC, Flav, and NBI and crop maturity for different crops and ecological areas. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

            "text": "In the recent decades, Norway spruce forests (Picea abies Karst.) in Europe have been subject to large-scale tree mortality caused by the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). The outbreaks were induced by storm-felling events and periods of drought, which are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change. Because storms and droughts spatially affect forests differently, the infestation patterns and configuration of the bark beetles might differ between storms and drought. In this study, we examined local and landscape factors associated with bark beetle-caused tree mortality after one storm (2005) and one drought-induced spruce bark beetle outbreak (2018), both occurring in southern Sweden. A total of 13,192 infested one-ha pixels after the storm and 6,425 one-ha pixels after the drought (in total 19,617) were compared regarding differences in infestation occurrence and size and associated forest structures and climate between the two different outbreaks, using a generalized linear model (GLM) approach. Based on our findings, we discovered that the allocation of infestation patch sizes (including four classes: 5\u201310, 11\u201325, 26\u201350 and >50 infested trees) for the two outbreaks were quite similar with a large proportion (>0.6) of small groups (\u226410 trees). However, the outcomes from this study demonstrate that the drivers behind the spatial configuration of bark beetle infestations can differ considerably between outbreaks triggered by storms and droughts, and the main cause seems to be linked to the spatial distribution of susceptible trees. The most consistent differences for both occurrence and infestation size were that storm-induced infestations increased more with spruce volumes and area of protected forests (nature reserves) in the landscape; whereas for the drought-induced infestations, occurrence and size increased more with clear-cuts in the landscape and spruce heights across spatial scales. Soil moisture and mean drought index (SPEI; May-July) were important for both outbreaks, but generally more important for the infestation sizes after droughts than after storms and may involve a time-lagged effect. The reasoning behind the differences between storms and droughts may be that during storm-induced outbreaks, when the wind-felled trees are removed or not suitable anymore, bark beetles need to find specific susceptible standing trees, while after drought all trees are more or less stressed, which results in a selection of large trees in dry and warm landscapes as they have more resources and favorable reproduction conditions. Finally, we show that the previous infestation size influenced the later infestation size negatively within landscapes of 25 ha and this seems to be related to depletion of susceptible host trees. These results are important for the assessment of more specific outbreak predictions, which should be integrated in future risk mapping of bark beetle outbreaks. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)"

In this study, we presented an automatic image-based workflow to obtain the accurate estimations for basic leaf characteristics (e.g., ratio of length/width, length, width, and area) from a hundred Populus simonii pictures, which were captured on Colony counter Scan1200. The image-based workflow was implemented with Python and OpenCV, and subdivided into three parts, including image pre-processing, image segmentation and object contour detection. Six image segmentation methods, including Chan-Vese, Iterative threshold, K-Mean, Mean, OSTU, and Watershed, differed in the running time, noise sensitivity and accuracy. The image-based estimates and measured values for leaf morphological traits had a strong correlation coefficient (r2 > 0.9736), and their residual errors followed a Gaussian distribution with a mean of almost zero. Iterative threshold, K-Mean, OSTU, and Watershed overperformed the other two methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. This study highlights the high-quality and high-throughput of autonomous image-based phenotyping and offers a guiding clue for the practical use of suitable image-based technologies in biological and ecological research. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

It is a dynamic process in which performance inherently varies. While research has focused on characterizing or maximizing (oo)cyst removal in individual filters, the risk implications of combinations of filters moving through different phases of the filter cycle (leading to temporal variation in plant-scale performance) have not been described. Increasing threats from climate-change-exacerbated landscape disturbances leading to more variable source water quality emphasize the need for such evaluations. Here, a modeling framework was developed to investigate the impacts of individual filter performance variation on plant-scale performance. It is shown that improving maximal removal during stable operation does not necessarily improve average performance. The effect of other design and operational strategies like increasing the number of filters or implementing proactive operations (e.g., avoiding breakthrough) are analyzed, thereby providing guidance for increasing treatment resilience. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

In this work, a novel method for synergistic extraction of anthocyanins from Purple-heart Radish was developed by combining microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) with enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE). Integration of MAE and EAE was optimized by screening various enzymes and combination approaches, followed by investigation of process parameters with single-factor experiments and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized conditions by RSM were as follow: 25.0 g/100 g cellulase dosage, 60 mL/100 mL ethanol concentration, pH 4.0, 50 \u00b0C temperature, 7.15 min extraction time, 80 mesh particle size and 60:1 mL/g liquid-to-material ratio, yielding a maximum response predicted and experimental values of 6.292 and 6.125 \u00b1 0.034 mg/g respectively. Based on the synergistic effect, MAE-EAE achieved higher extraction efficiency compared to the other extraction methods such as MAE, UAE and EAE etc. By means of HPLC-Q-Orbitrap/MS and HPLC, 11 anthocyanins extracted were identified and quantified as pelargonins with different glucosides, exhibiting quite homologous fragmentation pattern, biometabolic products and satisfactory yield. The antioxidation capacity of the extracted and purified products was evaluated by DPPH, ABTS and anti-lipid peroxidant assays, suggesting that the anthocyanins purified by the macroporous resin had stronger antioxidant activity. This study provided an efficient and promising approach to improve extraction of the anthocyanins from Purple-heart Radish, and a new source of pelargonins as a powerful antioxidant to be developed. \u00a9 2023"

However, in wheat, information related to GIS in the glume is scarce. Thus, we applied LC\u2013MS/MS-based metabolomics analysis to explore the polyphenols and phytohormones profiles of two contrasting wheat genotypes, Lincang Hulled Wheat (LHW, PHS-resistant) and Yunmai53 (Yun53, PHS-highly susceptible). Physiological tests revealed that LHW PHS-resistance is not associated with the ability of its spikelet to prevent water absorption. The total polyphenol content of the spikes and shells of LHW was significantly higher than that of Yun53, respectively. In total, 214 phenolic compounds classified mainly into phenolic acids (42.52%), flavones (23.83%), and flavonoid carbonosides (16.36%) were identified. 180 differentially accumulated polyphenols (DAPs) were uncovered, including 168 up-regulated in LHW. 24 most up-regulated DAPs (Log2FC \u2265 8) were unveiled as potential candidate GISs. Of the identified phytohormones, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid exhibited significantly higher content in LHW compared to Yun53. Whereas, Yun53 contained significantly higher levels of ethylene and gibberellin than LHW. Our findings offer new resources for PHS control in wheat. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s)."

To tap into the physiological roles of 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP, we used a chemo-proteomics approach, thermal proteome profiling (TPP), for the unbiased identification of 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP protein targets. TPP measures shifts in the protein thermal stability upon ligand binding. Comprehensive proteomics analysis yielded a list of 51 proteins significantly altered in their thermal stability upon incubation with 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP. The list contained metabolic enzymes, ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors, and proteins associated with the regulation of plant growth such as CELL DIVISION CYCLE 48. To functionally validate obtained results, we focused on the role of 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP in regulating the actin cytoskeleton suggested by the presence of actin among the 51 identified proteins. 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP supplementation affected actin organization by inducing actin-bundling. Consistent with these results, the increase in 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP levels, obtained either by feeding or by chemical modulation of 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP metabolism, was sufficient to partially rescue the short hypocotyl phenotype of the actin2 actin7 mutant, severely compromised in actin level. The observed rescue was specific to 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP, as demonstrated using a positional isomer 2\u2032,3\u2032-cAMP, and true for the nanomolar 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP concentrations reported for plant cells. In vitro characterization of the 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP\u2013actin pairing argues against a direct interaction between actin and 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP. Alternative mechanisms by which 3\u2032,5\u2032-cAMP would affect actin dynamics, such as by interfering with calcium signaling, are discussed.

High salinity of irrigation water is one of the main barriers inhibiting the growth of rosemary cultivation in Egypt's new reclamation zones. Chitosan is a natural biopolymer which is obtained from the deacetylation of chitin and has a high potential to improve plant productivity under stressful conditions. So, this study aimed to minimize the negative effects of salty irrigation water on rosemary plants by assisting them in adjusting to salt stress through foliar application of chitosan to determine the potential for increasing their cultivation in the new reclamation zones as a natural supply of essential oil. Rosemary plants were subjected to different doses of salty irrigation water (0, 25.7, 51.3, 77.0, 102.6 mM) without or with chitosan (6 mg L-1). Plants irrigated by salty water with spraying chitosan resulted in higher values of plant aerial parts, photosynthetic pigments, carbohydrates, protein, phenols, flavonoids, antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase and superoxide dismutase), essential oil, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium than those irrigated by salty water without chitosan. In contrast, lower amounts were found in free radical scavenging, sodium and chloride of plant treated with salty water x chitosan than those treated with saline water only. Saline water, chitosan, and their interactions caused a number of changes in detected amino acids and essential oil components. It may be summarized that productivity of rosemary plants can be improved with adapting them under saline irrigation conditions by adding chitosan. This trial benefits the producers of rosemary to alleviate the hurtful effects of saline water in reclaimed regions with adding chitosan. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

Results showed that aroma attribute and AOC composition of five EOs differ largely. The 39 (20 plus 19) differential AOCs screened accounted for their differences among five EOs. Concentrations of limonene-D, \u03b2-pinene, \u03b1-maaliene, senkyunolide, and 9-octadecenoic acid, (E) in IMX, \u03b1-pinene oxide, \u03b1-thujene, and isosativene in FFL, senkyunolide and n-hexadecanoic acid in CJX, and \u03b2-myrcene in ADO were largest (P < 0.05). Furthermore, strong correlation between aroma and AOCs suggested that W1S and W2S aroma detected by E-nose could be more suitable for predicting the levels of terpenoids of \u03b2-myrcene-D, \u03b2-pinene-D, \u03b1-thujene, \u03b1-pinene oxide, and \u03b1-maaliene in five EOs. Results could provide a theoretical reference for fast recognition, selection, and application of commercially EOs. \u00a9 2023"

Spectroscopic techniques in remote sensing offer less laborious methods and high spatiotemporal scale to monitor diseases in crops. Spectral measurements during the development of disease infection may reveal differences among diseases and determine the stage it can be effectively detected. In this study, spectral analysis was performed over the visible and near-infrared (400\u2013850 nm) portions of the spectrum to detect and differentiate three major rice diseases in the Philippines, namely tungro, BLB, and blast disease. Reflectance of infected rice leaves was recorded repeatedly from inoculation to the late stage of each disease. Results show that spectral reflectance is characteristically affected by each disease, resulting in different spectral, signature sensitivity, and first-order derivatives. Red and red-edge wavelength ranges are the most sensitive to the three diseases. Near-infrared wavelengths decreased as tungro and blast diseases progressed. In addition, the spectral reflectance was resampled to common reflectance sensitivity bands of optical sensors and used in the cluster analysis. It showed that BLB and blast can be detected in the early disease stage on the IRRI Standard Evaluation System (SES) scale of 1 and 3, respectively. Alternatively, tungro was detected in its later stage, with an 11\u201330% height reduction and no distinct yellow to yellow-orange discoloration (5 SES scale). Three regression techniques, Partial Least Square, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression were performed separately on each disease to develop models predicting its severity. The validation results of the PLSR and SVR models in tungro and blast show accuracy levels that are promising to be used in estimating the severity of the disease in leaves while RFR shows the best results for BLB. Early disease detection and regression models from spectral measurements and analysis for disease severity estimation can help in disease monitoring and proper disease management implementation. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

As small decentralized power generation units are increasingly expected to be operated on demand, start-ups will occur more frequently and thus the importance of the warm-up process will further increase. In this study, we address this problem by presenting a mathematical optimization framework that finds optimal actuator trajectories that significantly reduce the warm-up time and improve the thermal efficiency of an mCHP plant. The proposed optimization framework is highly flexible and adaptable to various objective functions, such as maximizing efficiency or minimizing the deviation from desired temperature references. The underlying mathematical model has been experimentally validated on a physical mCHP test rig. Selected case studies further demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the framework and show that with the optimized actuator trajectories, the mCHP plant can reach its steady-state operating temperature in 40% less time. The results also indicate that the shortest warm-up time does not necessarily lead to the highest thermal efficiency. Accordingly, the methodology proposed in this paper provides a powerful tool to study higher-level operational strategies of mCHP plants and thus to maximize their overall performance, which directly translates into an improved operational cost-effectiveness, particularly in demand-driven energy landscapes. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

An effective strategy for dwarfing cultivation is the exogenous application of plant growth regulators (PGRs) to plants. However, for many non-wood forest species, there is currently limited understanding of the regulatory mechanism of dwarfing effects of PGRs, which greatly limits the application of PGRs. In this study, three PGRs, paclobutrazol (PP333), uniconazole (S3307), and chlormequat chloride (CCC) were applied to dwarf terpinen-4-ol M. alternifolia. By observing the morphological characteristics and leaf anatomy of M. alternifolia after dwarfing and measuring its photosynthetic characteristics and physiological and biochemical indexes, the dwarfing effect of the three PGRs and the underlying mechanisms were investigated to provide a reference for the cultivation of M. alternifolia by dwarfing. The results show that the PP333 (P3) treatment at 2000 mg\u00b7L\u22121 had the best dwarfing effect on M. alternifolia, with a compact plant shape, thicker stems, and green leaf color. At the same time, it increased the chlorophyll contents, changed the blade structure, increased the content of soluble substances and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, increased the endogenous hormones indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin A3 (GA3), and trans-zeatin-riboside (ZR), and decreased abscisic acid (ABA) levels. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

In the present study, we aimed to ascertain the impact of Glutamic-acid-functionalized iron nanoparticles (Glu-FeNPs) on two varieties (NM-92 and AZRI-2006) of mung beans with different concentrations (0, 40 mM, 60 mM, and 80 mM) of osmotic stress. The result of the study showed that vegetative growth parameters such as root and shoot length, fresh and dry biomass, moisture contents, leaf area, and the number of pods per plant were significantly decreased with osmotic stress. Similarly, biochemicals such as protein, chlorophylls, and carotenes contents also significantly declined under induced osmotic stress. The application of Glu-FeNPs significantly (p \u2264 0.05) restored both the vegetative growth parameters and biochemical contents of plants under osmotic stress. The pre-sowing treatment of seeds with Glu-FeNPs significantly ameliorated the tolerance level of Vigna radiata to osmotic stress by optimizing the level of antioxidant enzymes and osmolytes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and proline contents. Our finding indicates that Glu-FeNPs significantly restore the growth of plants under osmotic stress via enhancing photosynthetic activity and triggering the antioxidation system of both varieties. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Here, the major flavonoids and endophytic bacterial communities in various Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. roots collected from seven distinct places in northwest China, as well as the edaphic conditions, were characterized and analyzed. It was found that the soil moisture and temperature might modulate the secondary metabolism in G. uralensis roots partially through some endophytes. One rationally isolated endophyte Rhizobium rhizolycopersici GUH21 was proved to promote the accumulation of isoliquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid significantly in roots of the potted G. uralensis under the relatively high-level watering and low temperature. Furthermore, we did the comparative transcriptome analysis of G. uralensis seedling roots in different treatments to investigate the detailed mechanisms of the environment-endophyte-plant interactions and found that the low temperature went hand in hand with the high-level watering to activate the aglycone biosynthesis in G. uralensis, while GUH21 and the high-level watering cooperatively promoted the in planta glucosyl unit production. Our study is of significance for the development of methods to rationally promote the medicinal plant quality. Key points: \u2022 Soil temperature and moisture related to isoliquiritin contents in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. \u2022 Soil temperature and moisture related to the hosts\u2019 endophytic bacterial community structures. \u2022 The causal relation among abiotic factors\u2014endophytes\u2014host was proved through the pot experiment. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s)."

Here, this aspect of sensing was employed in the terahertz (THz) range for mapping liquid water in the plucked leaves of Bambusa vulgaris and Celtis sinensis. Two complementary techniques, broadband THz time-domain spectroscopic imaging and THz quantum cascade laser-based imaging, were utilized. The resulting hydration maps capture the spatial variations within the leaves as well as the hydration dynamics in various time scales. Although both techniques employed raster scanning to acquire the THz image, the results provide very distinct and different information. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy provides rich spectral and phase information detailing the dehydration effects on the leaf structure, while THz quantum cascade laser-based laser feedback interferometry gives insight into the fast dynamic variation in dehydration patterns. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

The aim of the current study was to use energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF) to determine the concentrations of Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn in the stems and leaves of the African spider plant (Cleome gynandra) in the context of nutrition. Stems and leaves of the African spider plant grown in the highland and in the lowland of Molo Ward, Nakuru, Kenya, were found to contain total available Zn in the range of 140 \u00b1 50 to 230 \u00b1 60 mg/kg, Fe in the range of 2200 \u00b1 700 to 3900 \u00b1 1700 mg/kg, Cu at 13 \u00b1 3 to 16 \u00b1 5\u00a0mg/kg, and Mn at 380 \u00b1 120 to 400 \u00b1 140 mg/kg. There was no significant difference in the average concentrations of the trace elements in the leaves and stems of the African spider plant from the lowland and highland regions of Molo Ward (p > 0.05). The concentrations of Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn in the African spider plants is high enough to make it a nutritious traditional vegetable. Therefore, farmers should be encouraged and empowered to grow more vegetables. \u00a9 2023 The Authors. X-Ray Spectrometry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Both molecules show thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), however, the efficiency of the TADF mechanism is strongly affected by the D\u2013A substitution position. The meta- substituted emitter (1 b) shows a slightly higher-lying singlet charge transfer state and a lower-lying triplet state than that observed in the para- substituted emitter (1 a), resulting in a larger singlet\u2013triplet splitting (\u0394EST) of 0.28 eV compared to only 0.01 eV found in 1 a. As expected, this \u0394EST difference strongly impacts the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) rates and the para- isomer 1 a exhibits a much faster delayed fluorescence emission. Calculations show that the triplet energy difference between the two isomers is due to steric hindrance variances along the donor\u2013acceptor rotation axis in these molecules: as 1 b is less restricted, rotation of its acceptor unit leads to a lower T1 energy, further away from the region of high density of states (the region where larger vibronic coupling is found, favouring rISC). Therefore, our results show how the substitution pattern has a marked effect on triplet state energies and character, verifying the key structural designs for highly efficient TADF materials. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Epidemiological data revealed that some FDp strains appear to be more widespread and aggressive. However, there is no data on mechanisms underlying the variable pathogenicity among strains. In this research, we employed chromatographic and spectrophotometric techniques to assess how two strains of FDp influence the levels of grapevine phenolic compounds, which are frequently utilized as indicative markers of stress conditions. The results pointed to the upregulation of all branches of phenolic metabolism through the development of infection, correlating with the increase in antioxidative capacity. The more aggressive strain M54 induced stronger downregulation of phenolics\u2019 accumulation at the beginning and higher upregulation by the end of the season than the less aggressive M38 strain. These findings reveal potential targets of FDp effectors and provide the first functional demonstration of variable pathogenicity between FDp strains, suggesting the need for future comparative genomic analyses of FDp strains as an important factor in exploring the management possibilities of FDp. \u00a9 2023 American Chemical Society."

A lower surface albedo generates greater amounts of energy absorption and makes the surface, and subsequently the wood, warmer and dryer. This study was carried out to increase knowledge of how different coating colours impact the temperature of the underlaying wood, and the effect this has on the moisture content (MC). The study was performed by exposing panels of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.] painted with three different colours (white, red, and black) to natural sunlight over a month during summer. Each panel fitted with a dry-bulb humidity sensor inside. The results showed a greater variation in calculated equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in the darker panels, since the temperature reached higher levels than the white panels when exposed to sunlight. The maximum recorded temperature was around 50 \u00b0C for the dark panels while the maximum for white was around 40 \u00b0C. Furthermore, it was shown that the temperature inside the panel reaches its maximum around the same time as the outside air, while the maximum values for EMC were recorded approximately 8-9 hours apart between the panels and the outside air. \u00a9 (2023) WORLD CONFERENCE ON TIMBER ENGINEERING 2023 (WCTE 2023) All rights reserved."

Honokiol (HNK) is a kind of lignan extracted from Chinese herbal medicine Houpu, many domestic and international experiments have demonstrated its anti-tumor effect. Titanium dioxide nanotube (TNTs) is a kind of nanomaterial which can be used as drug carrier. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of HNK-loaded TNTs delivery system (HNK-TNTs) on anti-tumor. Methods: TNTs were prepared by anodic oxidation method, and HNK was loaded onto TNTs by physical adsorption. The effect of HNK-TNTs on the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of CAL-27 cells were explored by CCK-8 experiment, scratch assay, live and dead staining and cellular immunofluorescence analysis. Results: The material characterization test results showed that we had successfully prepared HNK-TNTs. CCK-8 experiment, scratch assay showed that the proliferation and migration ability of CAL-27 cells were significantly weakened after treatment with HNK-TNTs, and their cell proliferation rates significantly decreased. Live/dead staining, cell immunofluorescence analysis showed that HNK-TNTs could promote CAL-27 cells apoptosis by increasing the expression levels of the apoptosis-related protein Bax and Fas. Conclusion: In this experiment, we had successfully prepared Honokiol-loaded titanium dioxide nanotube drug delivery system (HNK-TNTs) and compared the effects of single drug HNK and HNK-TNTs on the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of tongue cancer CAL-27 cells. This experiment showed that HNK-TNTs had greater anti-proliferative, apoptosis-promoting and migration-inhibiting effects than the HNK as a single drug. Copyright \u00a9 2023 Tang, Su and Qu."

The effects of exogenous application of melatonin (100, 200, and 300 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u22121) on the growth, photosynthetic characteristics, leaf anatomy, and physiological and biochemical properties of blueberry plants under mixed salt stress (90 mmol\u00b7L\u22121: 30 mmol\u00b7L\u22121 Na2CO3 + 60 mmol\u00b7L\u22121 NaCl) were investigated. The results showed that blueberries under 90 mmol\u00b7L\u22121 mixed salt stress had significant salt damage symptoms, with reduced blueberry biomass, reduced chlorophyll content, and photosynthesis inhibition. In contrast, melatonin-treated blueberries showed significantly reduced salt damage symptoms compared with stressed blueberry plants, with the optimum effect at 200 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u22121, along with increased chlorophyll content, improved photosynthetic capacity, and increased leaf thickness under stress. Melatonin treatment resulted in reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content and relative electrolyte leakage (EL), increased K+ content, and decreased Na+ content in blueberry roots, stems and leaves, thereby reducing the toxic effects of mixed salts on blueberries. The results indicate that melatonin can mitigate the effects of mixed salt stress on blueberries and that foliar spraying of melatonin could alleviate mixed salt-induced damage to blueberries, with the optimum effect at 200 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u22121 treatment. This study provided a valuable basis for exploring the mechanism of exogenous melatonin action in blueberries in saline environments. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The present study investigates the microwave-assisted extraction of polyphenols from the Pithecellobium dulce fruit peels. ANOVA pareto analysis and Response surface methodology was employed to analyse the effect of process variables on delignification. Four independent process variables such as microwave irradiation power, microwave irradiation time, pH and Liquid to solid ratio (LSR) were analysed. Microwave-assisted aqueous extraction facilitated in maximum yield of polyphenols from the fruit peels (79.18\u00a0mg GAE/g dw). The polyphenol extract exhibited potential antioxidant (IC50 of 63.18\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and anticancer (LD50 of 61.3\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) activity using radical scavenging DPPH and MTT assay respectively. Therefore, our study indicates that the polyphenolics rich, biologically potent Pithecellobium dulce fruit peel extracts can be a good therapeutic and nutraceutical supplement to treat cancer and related complications.

In this study, four dominant tree species in the karst forest of Maolan, Guizhou Province, were selected, and their water-use strategies and the mechanism of maintenance of tree species diversity were investigated using the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope tracing technique. The results show that: (1) The regional precipitation varied evidently with the alternation of seasons, i.e., the values of \u03b4D and \u03b418O in precipitation had a positive bias in spring and a negative bias in summer and autumn. The value of deuterium excess (d-excess) was between 11.67\u2030 and 31.02\u2030, with a mean value of 22.98\u2030. (2) The soil temperature (ST), soil water content (SWC) and precipitation, which have a significant positive correlation, imposed a joint impact on the dynamics of the soil evaporative fractionation. (3) The line-conditioned excess (LC-excess) varied seasonally in different water bodies, i.e., the relative evaporative fractionation of the rhizosphere soil of deciduous tree species was stronger than that of evergreen tree species, and the evaporative fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the leaf water of evergreen tree species was stronger than that of deciduous tree species in spring and summer. However, that of the latter was stronger than that of the former in autumn. (4) The soil water was the most important potential water source for dominant tree species in karst terrain (71%), followed by epikarstic water, which made up an effective supplement (29%). (5) Finally, trees of different life forms and species varied in capacity and proportion in terms of using the potential water sources in different seasons, i.e., deciduous tree species had a greater capacity for using water from potential sources and variable water-use strategies. This may be a major water-limiting mechanism that maintains photosynthesis in the leaves of evergreen tree species (leaves are evergreen and plants continue to grow via photosynthesis) and constrains photosynthesis in deciduous tree species (leaves fall and plants become dormant and stop growing). These results lead to the conclusion that the dominant tree species in karstic forests resist water stress and adjust water-use strategies towards each potential water source to adapt to the harsh karstic habitat through root plasticity and leaf defoliation. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Exploring the behavior of Asian elephants will help to better protect this endangered species and further realize the harmonious coexistence of humans and elephants. Based on the news texts regarding the northward migration of Asian elephants, this study used network text analysis, social network analysis, and grounded theoretical research methods to explore the behavioral characteristics and internal motivations of Asian elephants during their northward migration. The results indicate that: (1) during the northward migration of Asian elephants, moving and foraging are their most frequent behaviors, and foraging may be the chief purpose of the migration. (2) Different behaviors of Asian elephants hide their behavioral choice preferences, including environmental, time, and behavioral preferences. During the migration, Asian elephants mostly move in low-altitude areas, often foraging or migrating around farmland in the afternoon or at night, returning to the mountains to rest in the early morning. Corn, rice, and other crops are their primary food; the change in their eating habits is influenced by the lack of herbs and woody plants inside the protected area. (3) The northward migration behavior of elephant herds is influenced by various factors, such as elephant population expansion, habitat change, and species migration characteristics, and the relationship between conservation and development needs to be balanced. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Pinus densiflora is an essential tree species with ecological and economic value, and its natural distribution shows a disjunct pattern. Using transcriptome-level SNP data from 220 samples representing 32 naturally-distributed populations in East Asia, we investigated Pinus densiflora genetic diversity and structure, divergence time, and ancestral distribution. We identified five subpopulations which diverged approximately 2.02\u20131.49 million years ago, and found relatively low genetic differentiation among the three large subpopulations (SL, JH, and JK). Northeast China is the most likely origin, and its current distribution is the result of dispersal and vicariance events. It migrated southwest through the Liaodong Peninsula to the Shandong Peninsula and southeast through the Korean Peninsula to Japan. These results provide a basis for the conservation and management of P. densiflora in the future and the evolutionary study of species with similar life histories. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Results: There were differences between growth conditions in the levels of soil pH, salinity, SOM, and nutrient. The living status of T. chinensis exhibited higher capacity of decreasing saline-alkali soil than the death condition of plants, and the living T. chinensis showed higher uptake of N, P, and K as compared with the death samples. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Chloroflexi were the predominant bacterial communities as revealed via high-throughput sequencing. Conclusions: It is great potential for using halophytes such as T. chinensis to ecological restore the coastal saline-alkali soil. This study could contribute to a better understanding of halophyte growth during the coastal phytoremediation process, and guide theoretically for management of T. chinensis population. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential role of Benincasa hispida extracts on high salt-induced hypertension in Dahl-salt sensitive (D-SS) rats and to find out the metabolic and biochemical pattern involved in the reduction of hypertension. Twenty-six Dahl salt-sensitive (D-SS) rats were selected and divided into four groups. The metabolic strategy was applied to test the extracts on salt-sensitive hypertension in kidney. Gas Chromatography\u2013Mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) was used to identify the potent biochemical profile in renal medulla and cortex of rat kidneys. The differential metabolites of cortex and medulla, enrichment analysis and pathway analysis were performed using metabolomics data. The GC\u2013MS data revealed that 24 different antihypertensive metabolites was detected in renal cortex, while 16 were detected in renal medulla between different groups. The significantly metabolic pathways namely citrate cycle, glutathione metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism in renal cortex and glycerolipid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, glycolysis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis in renal medulla were involved in the process of Hypertension. The results suggest that the extract mainly alter the metabolic pathways of amino acid in Dahl salt-sensitive rats and its antioxidant potential reduced the hypertension patterns of Salt-sensitive rat. The antihypertensive components malic acid, aspartic acid, and glycine of extract can be used as therapeutic drugs to protect kidneys from salt-induced hypertension. Practical applications: Hypertension is a multifactorial disease and one of the risk factors for heart and kidney failure. Benincasa hispida is a widely used vegetable in China, which belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family. Benincasa hispida (wax gourd) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of inflammation and hypertension. The Benincasa hispida contains many compounds such as amino acids, carbohydrates, volatile compounds, vitamins, and minerals. The amino acid present in the pulp of Benincasa hispida are ornithine, threonine, aspartate, glutamate, serine, glycine, proline, alanine, valine, cysteine, isoleucine, tyrosine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, histidine, arginine, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid. Our results showed that Benincasa hispida is one of the potent natural antioxidants and can maintain normal blood pressure in Dahl salt-sensitive rats (D-SS). In conclusion, the current results provide good theoretical basis for the development and research using Benincasa hispida as an effective natural antioxidant for hypertension. \u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

            "text": "Photosynthesis is a key process in sustaining plant and human life. Improving the photosynthetic capacity of agricultural crops is an attractive means to increase their yields. While the core mechanisms of photosynthesis are highly conserved in C3 plants, these mechanisms are very flexible, allowing considerable diversity in photosynthetic properties. Among this diversity is the maintenance of high photosynthetic light-use efficiency at high irradiance as identified in a small number of exceptional C3 species. Hirschfeldia incana, a member of the Brassicaceae family, is such an exceptional species, and because it is easy to grow, it is an excellent model for studying the genetic and physiological basis of this trait. Here, we present a reference genome of H. incana and confirm its high photosynthetic light-use efficiency. While H. incana has the highest photosynthetic rates found so far in the Brassicaceae, the light-saturated assimilation rates of closely related Brassica rapa and Brassica nigra are also high. The H. incana genome has extensively diversified from that of B. rapa and B. nigra through large chromosomal rearrangements, species-specific transposon activity, and differential retention of duplicated genes. Duplicated genes in H. incana, B. rapa, and B. nigra that are involved in photosynthesis and/or photoprotection show a positive correlation between copy number and gene expression, providing leads into the mechanisms underlying the high photosynthetic efficiency of these species. Our work demonstrates that the H. incana genome serves as a valuable resource for studying the evolution of high photosynthetic light-use efficiency and enhancing photosynthetic rates in crop species. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

            "text": "The lack of access to clean water worldwide and organic, inorganic as well as biological contamination of existing freshwater sources are a major problem for around 2 billion people, especially in the countries of the global south. One sign of polluted water is turbidity. It is generally caused by colloidal and particulate suspended solids. Chemical flocculants are often used to reduce turbidity and thus eliminate the mostly harmful substances that cause it. However, these have some disadvantages, such as cost and availability, so increasingly natural plant-based flocculants are coming into focus and are considered as an alternative option. In this study, Moringa seeds (Moringa oleifera) and cactus cladodes (Opuntia ficus-indica) were investigated as innovative and environmentally friendly flocculants for water treatment. The parameters investigated included absolute turbidity reduction and flocculation activity, as well as shear strength of the resulting flocs. The flocculation experiments were conducted as simultaneous tests in beakers. Experiments were conducted using both a laboratory-prepared model suspension with an initial turbidity of approximately 139 NTU and natural surface water with an initial turbidity of approximately 136 NTU. The flocculant dosages used ranged from 100 to 300 mg/L. The results show that although Moringa seeds had the highest flocculation activity (up to 93%), the flocs were very fragile and were destroyed again even at low induced shear forces. Flocculants from cactus yielded stable flocs, but the flocculation activity (maximum at 54%) was not as high as that of Moringa. The combination of the two materials resulted in a flocculant with sufficiently high flocculation activity (76%) and stable flocs, which could withstand higher shear forces potentially induced in further treatment steps. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

In the field experiment, we compared two optical experimental methods, terrestrial lidar and aerial photogrammetry, with manual defoliation of some selected vines. Like those of other authors, our results show that both terrestrial lidar and aerial photogrammetry were able to represent the canopy well with correlation coefficients around 0.9 between the measured variables and the number of leaves. We found that in the case of aerial photogrammetry, significantly more points were found in the point cloud, but this depended on the choice of the ground sampling distance. Our results show that in the case of aerial UAS photogrammetry, subdividing the vine canopy segments to 5 \u00d7 5 cm gives the best representation of the volume of vine canopies. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Yunnan Pu-erh tea is protected by geographical Indication and has unique quality characteristics. It is made from Yunnan large-leaf sun-green tea with specific processing techniques. The quality formation of Pu-erh tea is closely related to the soil\u2019s environmental conditions. In this paper, time-by-time data of the soil environment of tea plantations during the autumn tea harvesting period in Menghai County, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China, in 2021 were analyzed. Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis was conducted between the inner components of Pu\u2019er tea and the soil environmental factor. The analysis showed that three soil environmental indicators, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH, were highly significantly correlated. The soil environmental quality evaluation method was proposed based on the selected soil environmental characteristics. Meanwhile, a deep learning model of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network for the soil environmental quality of tea plantation was established according to the proposed method, and the soil environmental quality of tea was classified into four classes. In addition, the paper also compares the constructed models based on BP neural network and random forest to evaluate the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the indicators for comparative analysis. This paper innovatively proposes to introduce the main inclusions of Pu\u2019er tea into the classification and discrimination model of the soil environment in tea plantations, while using machine learning-related algorithms to classify and predict the categories of soil environmental quality, instead of relying solely on statistical data for analysis. This research work makes it possible to quickly and accurately determines the physiological status of tea leaves based on the establishment of a soil environment quality prediction model, which provides effective data for the intelligent management of tea plantations and has the advantage of rapid and low-cost assessment compared with the need to measure the intrinsic quality of Pu-erh tea after harvesting is completed. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

However, the effect of plant internal factors (such as phylogeny) on the variations in phenology among plant species remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic conservatism in spring phenological traits using phylogenetic signal and evolutionary models, including Brownian motion (BM) model, Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck (OU) model and white noise (WN) model, based on the phenological data of 48 temperate plant species in Northeast China. We also explored the relative contributions of phylogeny and adaptation to native climate (i.e., the climate in native range of species) to the variations in the phenological traits among species using phylogenetic eigenvector regression and variance partitioning analysis. The results showed thatspring phenological traits conformed to the OU model, indicating thatspring traits were phylogenetically conserved. The effect of phylogeny on flowering traits was stronger than that on leaf-out traits. Additionally, the adaptation to native climate contributed more to the variations in spring phenological traits among species than phylogeny, and adaptation to native climate explained more variations in leaf-out traits than in flowering traits. Our results suggested that the spring phenological traits were constrained by both phylogeny and adaptation to native climate. However, the adaptation to native climate had a stronger effect on the variations in phenological traits than phylogeny. Therefore, the degree of similarity in spring phenological traits across closely related species depends on the degree of similarity in the environmental conditions where these close relatives are distributed. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)"

This study aims to repurpose these kernels and seed wastes into added/high-value products and evaluate the ethanolic and methanolic extracts of their pressed marcs for polyphenolic content and potential antioxidant activity. The total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) in the marc extracts ranged between 47.87 and 376.0 mg GAE/g and 4.85 and 13.70 mg Rutin/g, respectively. Both mango kernel marc extracts showed higher potent reducing power, ABT\u1e60+ radical and DPP\u1e22 radical scavenging activities with half effective concentration (EC50) values (0.20\u20130.22 mg/mL) comparable to the reference compound; ascorbic acid (0.20 mg/mL). The TPC and TFC of the marc extracts generally strongly correlated with antioxidant activity. Relatively higher contents of xanthophyll and \u03b2-carotene were detected in bush mango kernel methanolic extract than in the other extracts. Extraction solvent affected the composition and content of bioactives in pressed marcs of njangsa seed and mango kernel. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

            "text": "The periodic impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir has significantly changed the composition and diversity of plant communities in the water-level-fluctuation zone (WLFZ), and its succession process can reflect and influence the changes of the whole reservoir bank ecosystem. At present, there is still a lack of long-term continuous observational records. Based on the monitoring data of fixed sample sites from June 2009 to June 2021 and leaf functional traits of dominant plants, this study analyzed the change trend of plant community diversity and the important value of dominant plants at the altitudes of 145-155 m, 155-165 m and 165-175 m in the WLFZ, and revealed the influence of reservoir operation characteristic parameters and meteorological factors on plant characteristics in the WLFZ through redundancy analysis. The results showed that: 1) dominant plants varied obviously in different elevation areas. The dominant species exhibiting higher important value (IV) at the altitude of 145-155 m and 155-165 m were Cynodon dactylon, Cyperus rotundus and Xanthium sibiricum with the higher water-tolerant capacity, while C. dactylon, Daucus carota and Bidens pilosa were dominant at the altitude of 165-175 m. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index of plant communities (1.47\u00b10.47) and the Pielou index (0.67\u00b10.07) at the altitude of 145-155 m were significantly lower than those at the altitude of 165-175 m. 2) From 2009 to 2021, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou index at the elevation of 145-155 m and 155-165 m decreased, while the importance value of C. dactylon and C. rotundus increased. 3) RDA analysis showed that the flooding time, number of periodic flooding and elevation can significantly affect the IV of dominant plants. The IV of species such as C. dactylon, A. philoxeroides and X. sibiricum were positively correlated with number of periodic flooding. The IV of Setaria viridis and Polygonum hydropiper were negatively correlated with number of periodic flooding. With increasing elevation, the IV of D. carota, B. pilosa and Artemisia annua increased, however, the IV of C. dactylon, C. rotundus and P. hydropiper declined. 4) The adaptation strategies of different plants varied. Specific leaf area (SLA) of C. dactylon (32.8\u00b17.2) mm2/mg was the largest, followed by B. pilosa (30.6\u00b13.9) mm2/mg and X. sibiricum (30.0\u00b13.0) mm2/mg. The SLA of these plans in the WLFZ were lower than those of plants in the unflooded area. 5) The investment proportion of S strategy of C. dactylon was 53.4% with high flooding-resistant ability. The investment proportion of C strategy of X. sibiricum was 61.3% with the largest leaf area. The proportions of R strategy of Comnyza canadensis and B. pilosa were 64.6% and 50.9% that have a lot of small seeds. The proportions of R strategy of A. philoxeroides was 71.3% with developed roots. The results of this study may deepen the scientific understanding of the change trend of plant communities and the ecological adaptation strategies of dominant plants in the WLFZ of large reservoirs. \u00a9 2023 by Journal of Lake Sciences."

            "text": "Polysaccharides are important biological macromolecules in all organisms, and have recently been studied as therapeutic agents for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the effects of Pinus yunnanensis pollen polysaccharides on ulcerative colitis remains unknown. In this study, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to induce the UC model to investigate the effects of Pinus yunnanensis pollen polysaccharides (PPM60) and sulfated polysaccharides (SPPM60) on UC. We evaluated the improvement of polysaccharides on UC by analyzing the levels of intestinal cytokines, serum metabolites and metabolic pathways, intestinal flora species diversity, and beneficial and harmful bacteria. The results show that purified PPM60 and its sulfated form SPPM60 effectively alleviated the disease progression of weight loss, colon shortening and intestinal injury in UC mice. On the intestinal immunity level, PPM60 and SPPM60 increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-10, and IL-13) and decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1). On the serum metabolism level, PPM60 and SPPM60 mainly regulated the abnormal serum metabolism of UC mice by regulating the energy-related and lipid-related metabolism pathways, respectively. On the intestinal flora level, PPM60 and SPPM60 reduced the abundance of harmful bacteria (such as Akkermansia and Aerococcus) and induced the abundance of beneficial bacteria (such as lactobacillus). In summary, this study is the first to evaluate the effects of PPM60 and SPPM60 on UC from the joint perspectives of intestinal immunity, serum metabolomics, and intestinal flora, which may provide an experimental basis for plant polysaccharides as an adjuvant clinical treatment of UC. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

            "text": "A major challenge in global crop production is mitigating yield loss due to plant diseases. One of the best strategies to control these losses is through breeding for disease resistance. One barrier to the identification of resistance genes is the quantification of disease severity, which is typically based on the determination of a subjective score by a human observer. We hypothesized that image-based, non-destructive measurements of plant morphology over an extended period after pathogen infection would capture subtle quantitative differences between genotypes, and thus enable identification of new disease resistance loci. To test this, we inoculated a genetically diverse biparental mapping population of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) with Ralstonia solanacearum, a soilborne pathogen that causes bacterial wilt disease. We acquired over 40 000 time-series images of disease progression in this population, and developed an image analysis pipeline providing a suite of 10 traits to quantify bacterial wilt disease based on plant shape and size. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses using image-based phenotyping for single and multi-traits identified QTLs that were both unique and shared compared with those identified by human assessment of wilting, and could detect QTLs earlier than human assessment. Expanding the phenotypic space of disease with image-based, non-destructive phenotyping both allowed earlier detection and identified new genetic components of resistance. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

During this research, 21 selfed (S1) and 42 open-pollinated (OP) progenies of fennel developed in 2017\u201318 were evaluated in the field under well-watered and water deficit conditions in two years (2019 and 2020) for phytochemical and productivity traits. GC\u2013MS analysis revealed that among the eight different compounds in the essential oil, trans-anethole, fenchone, estragole, and limonene were found to be the main constituents. Water deficit greatly decreased grain yield and essential oil content, \u03b1-pinene, trans-anethole, and anisaldehyde; while significantly increased \u03b2-myrcene, limonene, \u03b3-terpinene, fenchone, and estragole, in both populations. Compared with open-pollination, selfing reduced the mean performance of seed and essential oil yield, \u03b2-myrcene, and limonene under normal and water deficit conditions, and \u03b1-pinene under normal condition, demonstrating the effects of inbreeding on these traits. The relationship between \u03b3-terpinene and anisaldehyde was positive in the S1 population; while in the OP population, there was significant and negative association between these two constituents. The genetic analysis of traits indicated that additive gene action played an important role in controlling most of the traits, but that both additive and non-additive gene effects played a role in the genetic control of grain yield; indicating that selection based on an index may be more useful for improvement of grain yield in recurrent selection programs. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

However, very few studies have been conducted to investigate the chemical composition of volatile compounds from different developmental stages and plant parts of A. graveolens. In this study, we examined the distribution of volatile phenylpropenes, including dillapiole, in dill plants at various developmental stages. We observed that young dill seedlings accumulate high levels of dillapiole and apiole, whereas a negligible proportion was found in the flowering plants and dry seeds. Based on transcriptomics and co-expression approaches with phenylpropene biosynthesis genes, we identified dill cDNA encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase 1 (AgOMT1), an enzyme that can convert 6- and 2-hydroxymyristicin to dillapiole and apiole, respectively, via the methylation of the ortho-hydroxy group. The AgOMT1 protein shows an apparent Km value of 3.5\u00a0\u03bcm for 6-hydroxymyristicin and is 75% identical to the anise (Pimpinella anisum) O-methyltransferase (PaAIMT1) that can convert isoeugenol to methylisoeugenol via methylation of the hydroxy group at the para-position of the benzene ring. AgOMT1 showed a preference for 6-hydroxymyristicin, whereas PaAIMT1 displayed a large preference for isoeugenol. In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that substituting only a few residues can substantially affect the substrate specificity of these enzymes. Other plants belonging to the Apiaceae family contained homologous O-methyltransferase (OMT) proteins highly similar to AgOMT1, converting 6-hydroxymyristicin to dillapiole. Our results indicate that apiaceous phenylpropene OMTs with ortho-methylating activity evolved independently of phenylpropene OMTs of other plants and the enzymatic function of AgOMT1 and PaAIMT1 diverged recently. \u00a9 2022 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Wheat grass also has proven health benefits like moringa. Moringa leaves and wheat grass were dehydrated in a cabinet drier and powdered. These powders were analysed for physicochemical, optical, nutritional, functional, rheological, structural, and phytochemical characteristics. The developed powders were rich in protein, phenolic content, and antioxidant potential to be used for prophylactic purposes. Antioxidant value was observed as 88.86\u00b10.15, and 38.08\u00b10.32 mg/g and the total phenolic content as 149.30\u00b12.26 and 126.06\u00b10.47 mg GAE/100g for the moringa leaf and wheatgrass powder, respectively. During storage at room temperature for three months the antioxidant potential was reduced to almost 10-15%. The rapid loss of vital phytochemicals happens due to the process of oxidation, as powders were having higher exposed surface area to volume. Wet granulation method was applied for tablet formation from moringa leaf and/or wheatgrass powder. The tablets were tested for weight variations, hardness, disintegration, sedimentation characteristics, wetting volume, wetting time, and functional characteristics. Insignificant change in the antioxidant activity and TPC were observed on converting the powders into tablets. The detailed phytochemicals as present in the developed tablets may find role in prophylactic and therapeutic applications.  \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

            "text": "During fruit ripening, polygalacturonases (PGs) are key contributors to the softening process in many species. Apple is a crisp fruit that normally exhibits only minor changes to cell walls and limited fruit softening. Here, we explore the effects of PG overexpression during fruit development using transgenic apple lines overexpressing the ripening-related endo-POLYGALACTURONASE1 gene. MdPG1-overexpressing (PGox) fruit displayed early maturation/ripening with black seeds, conversion of starch to sugars and ethylene production occurring by 80 days after pollination (DAP). PGox fruit exhibited a striking, white-skinned phenotype that was evident from 60 DAP and most likely resulted from increased air spaces and separation of cells in the hypodermis due to degradation of the middle lamellae. Irregularities in the integrity of the epidermis and cuticle were also observed. By 120 DAP, PGox fruit cracked and showed lenticel-associated russeting. Increased cuticular permeability was associated with microcracks in the cuticle around lenticels and was correlated with reduced cortical firmness at all time points and extensive post-harvest water loss from the fruit, resulting in premature shrivelling. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that early maturation was associated with upregulation of genes involved in stress responses, and overexpression of MdPG1 also altered the expression of genes involved in cell wall metabolism (e.g. \u03b2-galactosidase, MD15G1221000) and ethylene biosynthesis (e.g. ACC synthase, MD14G1111500). The results show that upregulation of PG not only has dramatic effects on the structure of the fruit outer cell layers, indirectly affecting water status and turgor, but also has unexpected consequences for fruit development. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mercuric ion (Hg2+) on the oxidant response and calcium ion (Ca2+) in the protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. The protoplast cells were exposed to 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mmol/L Hg2+ for 0.5 and 1.0 h, respectively. To detect the effect of Hg2+ on the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) with the laser scanning confocal microscopy, 2\u2019 7\u2019-Dichlorofluorescent yellow Diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to label ROS in protoplast cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. The result of confocal microscopy analysis showed that the level of ROS was increased in protoplast cells after the treatments of 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mmol/L Hg2+. However, the activity of antioxidant enzymes Catalase (CAT), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), and Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH-PX) in protoplasts was decreased by 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mmol/L Hg2+ treatments. In addition, ion chromatography was used to study the effect of Hg2+ on the content of Ca2+ in the protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. It showed that the content of Ca2+ in the outer cell of protoplasts was increased after the treatments of 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mmol/L Hg2+. In conclusion, Hg2+ decreases the activity of antioxidant enzymes and induces the elevation of ROS in the protoplast cells. Mercuric ion inhibits the absorption of Ca2+ by protoplast cells and the change of Ca2+ content may affect ROS level in the protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. \u00a9 2023 Jun Xing, Rui Wu, Hui Yu, Cailing Yuan and Xue Yang."

This study is based on the fact that nature still holds many secrets and advice, this study. It was constructed based on a reference to the patterns of leaf venation patterns as a natural proposed solution for urban formations. Inspired by the arrangement and proportions of leaf veins, this study questions the functionality and aesthetics of an urban environment and aims to create an energy-efficient, sustainable and nature-friendly urban order as demanded by the times. It is assumed that the leaves, which are believed to contain the most effective transport system and area management, will also be an optimal reference for urban design. For this purpose, leaf samples of 38 woody broad-leaved plants were collected and photographed in their full entirety and in detail with a microscope between 1mm and 200\u00b5. From the leaf vein structure obtained from the samples, those suitable for urban setting were selected. In this selection, the methods of fractal analysis and Space Syntax were applied. Considering the functional requirements of a city, the effectiveness of the proposed urban facilities was analyzed with respect to the different functions. The study questioned the superiority of the proposed different urban formations to each other based on different leaf veins. In addition, the proposals were interpreted in accordance with the spatial theories and design principles of Norberg Schulz and Lynch. This study, which aims to bring biomimicry to life in the urban dimension, is seen as an alternative to ensure the healthy development of cities. \u00a9 2023 Gazi Universitesi Muhendislik-Mimarlik.

            "text": "Resveratrol, which is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, berries, peanuts, and medicinal plants, has previously been reported to perform several biological functions, including inhibition of hepatic fibrosis. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the major cellular source of matrix protein-secreting myofibroblasts, which are the major drivers of liver fibrogenesis. Numerous studies on the protective effects of resveratrol against liver fibrosis have focused on the inhibition of HSC activation. Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis might be intimately related. The mouse HSC line JS1 was stimulated with resveratrol to assess the mechanism and relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. Resveratrol modulated JS1 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, resveratrol inhibited JS1 cell activation and induced autophagy and apoptosis. This antifibrotic effect was attenuated when autophagy was inhibited using chloroquine (CQ) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or when apoptosis was inhibited using Z-VAD-FMK. Furthermore, whether the Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways were associated with the resveratrol-mediated induction of autophagy and apoptosis in JS1 cells was examined. The SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 reversed autophagy, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reversed both autophagy and apoptosis induced by resveratrol. These findings suggest that the SIRT1 and JNK signaling pathways may be involved in the resveratrol-mediated inhibition of HSC activation by regulating autophagy and apoptosis. SIRT1 may be responsible for inducing autophagy, while JNK affects both autophagy and apoptosis. This study highlighted autophagy and apoptosis as therapeutic targets by which resveratrol can attenuate fibrosis. Practical applications: Resveratrol, which is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, berries, peanuts, and medicinal plants, has previously been reported to inhibit hepatic fibrosis. Since activated HSCs are the major drivers of liver fibrogenesis, many studies on the anti-hepatic fibrosis effects of resveratrol have focused on inhibiting HSC activation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on HSC activation and focused on the mechanism by which resveratrol modulated autophagy and apoptosis in JS1 cells, a mouse immortalized HSC line. It was shown that resveratrol inhibited HSC activation by inducing autophagy and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and the mechanism may be associated with the SIRT1 and JNK signaling pathways. This study highlighted autophagy and apoptosis as therapeutic targets by which resveratrol can attenuate fibrosis. These findings may provide a new framework for understanding the mechanism by which resveratrol inhibits HSC activation. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Abstract: Cotton bacterial leaf blight (CBB), caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum (Xcm), has periodically been a damaging disease in the USA. Identification and deployment of genetic resistance in cotton cultivars is the most economical and efficient means of reducing crop losses due to CBB. In the current study, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CBB resistance using an elite diversity panel of 380 accessions, genotyped with the cotton single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 63\u00a0K array, and phenotyped with race-18 of CBB, localized the CBB resistance to a 2.01-Mb region in the long arm of chromosome D02. Molecular genetic mapping using an F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population showed the CBB resistance in cultivar Arkot 8102 was controlled by a single locus (BB-13). The BB-13 locus was mapped within the 0.95-cM interval near the telomeric region in the long arm of chromosome D02. Flanking SNP markers, i04890Gh and i04907Gh of the BB-13 locus, identified from the combined linkage analysis and GWAS, targeted it to a 371-Kb genomic region. Candidate gene analysis identified thirty putative gene sequences in the targeted genomic region. Nine of these putative genes and two NBS-LRR genes adjacent to the targeted region were putatively involved in plant disease resistance and are possible candidate genes for BB-13 locus. Genetic mapping and genomic targeting of the BB13 locus in the current study will help in cloning the CBB-resistant gene and establishing the molecular genetic architecture of the BB-13 locus towards developing durable resistance to CBB in cotton. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

CFoCF1 activity is regulated by the redox state of a Cys pair on its central axis, that is, the \u03b3 subunit (CF1-\u03b3). When the \u0394\u03bcH+ is formed by the photosynthetic electron transfer chain under light conditions, CF1-\u03b3 is reduced by thioredoxin (Trx), and the entire CFoCF1 enzyme is activated. The redox regulation of CFoCF1 is a key mechanism underlying the control of ATP synthesis under light conditions. In contrast, the oxidative deactivation process involving CFoCF1 has not been clarified. In the present study, we analyzed the oxidation of CF1-\u03b3 by two physiological oxidants in the chloroplast, namely the proteins Trx-like 2 and atypical Cys-His-rich Trx. Using the thylakoid membrane containing the reduced form of CFoCF1, we were able to assess the CF1-\u03b3 oxidation ability of these Trx-like proteins. Our kinetic analysis indicated that these proteins oxidized CF1-\u03b3 with a higher efficiency than that achieved by a chemical oxidant and typical chloroplast Trxs. Additionally, the CF1-\u03b3 oxidation rate due to Trx-like proteins and the affinity between them were changed markedly when \u0394\u03bcH+ formation across the thylakoid membrane was manipulated artificially. Collectively, these results indicate that the formation status of the \u0394\u03bcH+ controls the redox regulation of CFoCF1 to prevent energetic disadvantages in plants. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

            "text": "Koozh is a cereal-based fermented food product made from finger millet (Eleucine corocana) which is a neglected cereal and has a promising potential for health promotions. It is produced both traditionally and modernly using millet grain and is offered in both drinks and porridge. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) dominate Koozh's microbial composition. Koozh is a famous street snack in many areas of the world and is the most commonly consumed healthy meal during specific events. Koozh contains bioactive components, including p-Coumaric and ascorbic acid, which have several nutraceutical benefits such as anti-allergenicity, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, antioxidant activity, anti-carcinogenicity, and anti-diabetic activity. Additionally, Koozh is also used against various disorders like hypercholesterolemia, intermittent claudication, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and cardiovascular diseases. In the nutshell, there is adequate evidence in favor of the medicinal significance of Koozh but needs further scientific interest to explore its health endorsing aspects for strengthening the claims. Furthermore, the production technology, brief history, nutritional composition, and functional properties of Koozh are also in the limelight of the current review article. Novelty impact statement: Food security is under threat due to the growing population of emerging nations, climate change, and diminishing resources. As a result, in the future, we will not only need to manufacture more, and also efficient agriculture in order to survive on our planet. Traditionally, humans have used fermentation to preserve food, but they are unintentionally producing more nutritious and healthier food, which can help with a variety of health issues. Koozh contains bioactive components, including p-Coumaric and ascorbic acid, which have several nutraceutical benefits such as anti-allergenicity, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, antioxidant activity, anti-carcinogenicity, and anti-diabetic activity, which makes it novel. \u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Bound phenolics of spelt seeds were successfully released by different combinations of cellulase, xylanase, feruloyl esterase, \u03b1-amylase and protease. Samples treated with all five enzymes together showed significantly improved extractable p-coumaric, ferulic and p-hydroxybenzoic acid contents, particularly efficient antioxidant activity in ABTS\u2022+ scavenging activity and the highest extractable TPCs. By combining enzymatic treatment with germination and fermentation, extractable TPCs were increased by 28% and 458%, respectively. A combination of enzymatic treatment with germination and fermentation led to enormously increased extractable trans-ferulic acid content (5899% and 8263%, respectively). The bound fraction of enzymatic treated raw seeds showed lower decrease in intracellular oxidation than the corresponding extractable fraction, but a 24-fold higher uptake of hydroxycinnamic acids. Principal component analysis showed some similarities between extractable and bound fractions of enzymatic treated raw, germinated and fermented samples, mainly due to the increase in extractable acids content (biochemical parameters), especially cis-ferulic, caffeic and p-hydroxybenzoic acids. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

Palaeoecological analyzes offer the possibility of establishing a record of ecosystem change over time, and therefore setting reference conditions for their assessment, protection and restoration. To assess the impact of hydrological changes, fire and pollution (dust, metals from smelting) on peatland and forest ecosystems, we carried out high-resolution, multi-proxy palaeoecological investigations of two peat cores (50 cm long) from nearby locations at a peatland located in the protected area (nature reserve) of the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest (CE Poland). Our study revealed that: i) between about 1780 and 1920 CE high fire activity likely caused by humans led to a partly decline in dwarf shrubs at the sampling sites; ii) between about 1910 and 1930 CE distinctive changes in local and regional plant succession took place that can be considered as a sign of disturbance in the peatland ecosystems; iii) during the last three decades we recorded a recent decrease of trace metals and pollen indicating a decrease in human activity. These changes are synchronous with a decrease of industrial activity and curbing of emission through legislation as well as the ongoing depopulation of villages in E Poland that started in 1990. Our data suggest that even well-preserved peatlands, located in protected areas might be far from their pristine state, predominantly due to disturbance effects from the past still lingering on. Nevertheless, the studied area remains one of the best-preserved forest ecosystems in Europe, despite the negative impact of human activity (deforestation, fires, hunting) over the past few centuries. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

            "text": "Iron plaque is a Fe-containing oxide film produced by the\u00a0oxidation of Fe(II) in the rice root system under\u00a0the combined action of oxygen infiltration and other microorganisms. Owing to its special surface structure and physio-chemical properties, the iron plaque has a strong absorption capacity for a variety of heavy metal ions. This study aimed to first investigate the\u00a0effects of Fe species on the\u00a0geochemical fractionation of Tl in typical paddy soil systems affected by industrial activities, followed by\u00a0pot culture experiments to probe the\u00a0effects of Fe species on the\u00a0uptake and translocation of Tl in rice plants. The results of field work preliminarily showed that iron at different valences affected the conversion of the\u00a0Tl geochemical fraction in the soil. Oxidizable Tl exerted significant positive correlation relationships with Fe2+ and negative correlation relationships with Fe3+, while reducible Tl only displayed a positive correlation with Fe3+. Further analysis by pot culture experiments revealed that the contents of Fe were significantly positively correlated with Tl contents in Fe plaque (R2 = 0.529). In contrast, the water-soluble Tl contents in the soil were significantly negatively correlated with the contents of Fe (R2\u00a0=\u00a0\u2013\u00a00. 90, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). It suggests that the iron plaque promoted the absorption and fixation of Tl on the root surface of rice plants, causing\u00a0Tl to\u00a0accumulate in the iron plaque. Besides, the\u00a0Tl content in the Fe plaque on the root surface of rice plants was greater than that in the above-ground tissues, which indicates that most Fe plaque exerts a certain degree of inhibition on Tl migration into the above-ground tissues of rice plants. All these findings indicate that Fe film is also an important carrier of Tl transfer in the soil\u2013rice plant system, which provides new scientific support for the remediation of typical Tl-contaminated rice fields. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

Classical approaches based on the generation of variability and selection of better phenotypes from large variant collections have improved their efficacy and processivity due to the implementation of molecular biology techniques, particularly genomics, Next Generation Sequencing and other omics such as proteomics and metabolomics. In this regard, the identification of interesting variants before they develop the phenotype trait of interest with molecular markers has advanced the breeding process of new varieties. Moreover, the correlation of phenotype or biochemical traits with gene expression or protein abundance has boosted the identification of potential new regulators of the traits of interest, using a relatively low number of variants. These important breakthrough technologies, built on top of classical approaches, will be improved in the future by including the spatial variable, allowing the identification of gene(s) involved in key processes at the tissue and cell levels. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Karst.) stands across Europe. The high intensity of these factors often led to complete dieback of existing forest stands, as in Gorce National Park (Southern Poland). The aim of this study was to monitor land cover changes in subalpine Norway spruce stands and their dynamics in Gorce NP in the years 1977\u20132020 (43 years), with the use of archival remote sensing data. The study area was divided into two subareas: A\u2014the Kud\u0142o\u0144 and B\u2014the Jaworzyna range. Changes were tracked in six defined land cover classes, based on available aerial orthophotos and Landsat (NASA) imagery, with the help of the authors\u2019 photointerpretation key. The results showed that almost 50% of old-growth Norway spruce stands died in the analyzed time period (50.9% in subarea A; 48.8% in subarea B). However, young forests appeared in almost 17% of the study area (20.7% and 14.2% in subarea A and B, respectively). The dynamics of land cover changes were different for the analyzed subareas; in subarea A Norway spruce dieback processes weakened at the end of the analyzed time period, whereas in subarea B they maintained high intensity. The process of old-growth Norway spruce stands dieback is still occurring in Gorce NP, but it does not result in the disappearance of the whole subalpine spruce forest ecosystem but is rather a generational change, due to emerging young forests. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

To perform these experiments, the living system was materially welded into a newly developed Titanium Weighing Hollow Body (TWHB) with a laser. Three non-vital, also hermetically welded and high-vacuum suitable, externally identical TWHBs, filled with sand, served as controls. All TWHBs were equipped with a feedthrough and integrated light source. LEDs generated continuous light in all four bodies, which drove the photobiological processes in the vital test body and allowed long-term growth. Mass differences of the TWHBs were measured with a vacuum mass comparator at four points in time three months apart against two stainless steel mass standards. The expanded measurement uncertainty of the mass increase of the vital TWHB was calculated according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) in each of the three independent experiments. The mass gain of the vital over the three nonvital TWHBs over the total experimental period of 9 months was +18 \u03bcg with the expanded measurement uncertainty 30 \u03bcg. The resulting mass gain would have had to be > 48 \u03bc g $ > 48\\enspace {\\upmu }\\mathrm{g}$ to be considered statistically significant with a confidence level of 97.7%; time intervals over three and six months were also not significant. The study validates for the first time a methodology capable of measuring mass dynamics of living matter over time, when statistically sound conclusions with measurement uncertainties in the microgram range are required. This opens up a new level of precision mass measurements, which makes the methodology a candidate, e.g., for the verification of the principle of mass conservation in the life-sciences.  \u00a9 2022 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston."

The common strategy for delivering siRNA into intact plants using agrobacterium or viruses is complicated and time-consuming, limiting the application of RNAi in plant research. Here, a novel delivery method based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) is reported, which allows for the efficient delivery of siRNA into mature plant leaves via topical application without the aid of mechanical forces, achieving transient gene knockdown with up to 98% silencing efficiency at the molecular level. In addition, this method is nontoxic to plant leaves, enabling the repeated delivery of siRNA for long-term silencing. White spots and yellowing phenotypes are observed after spraying the MSN-siRNA complex targeted at phytoene desaturase and magnesium chelatase genes. After high light treatment, photobleaching phenotypes are also observed by spraying MSNs-siRNA targeted at genes into the Photosystem II repair cycle. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that MSNs can simultaneously silence multiple genes. The results suggest that MSN-mediated siRNA delivery is an effective tool for long-term multi-gene silencing, with great potential for application in plant functional genomic analyses and crop improvement. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

            "text": "Crop yield potential is intrinsically related to canopy photosynthesis; therefore, improving canopy photosynthetic efficiency is a major focus of current efforts to enhance crop yield. Canopy photosynthesis rate (Ac) is influenced by several factors, including plant architecture, leaf chlorophyll content, and leaf photosynthetic properties, which interact with each other. Identifying factors that restrict canopy photosynthesis and target adjustments to improve canopy photosynthesis in a specific crop cultivar pose an important challenge for the breeding community. To address this challenge, we developed a novel pipeline that utilizes factorial analysis, canopy photosynthesis modeling, and phenomics data collected using a 64-camera multi-view stereo system, enabling the dissection of the contributions of different factors to differences in canopy photosynthesis between maize cultivars. We applied this method to 2 maize varieties, W64A and A619, and found that leaf photosynthetic efficiency is the primary determinant (17.5% to 29.2%) of the difference in Ac between 2 maize varieties at all stages, and plant architecture at early stages also contribute to the difference in Ac (5.3% to 6.7%). Additionally, the contributions of each leaf photosynthetic parameter and plant architectural trait were dissected. We also found that the leaf photosynthetic parameters were linearly correlated with Ac and plant architecture traits were non-linearly related to Ac. This study developed a novel pipeline that provides a method for dissecting the relationship among individual phenotypes controlling the complex trait of canopy photosynthesis.

The architecture of the green space in the university is mainly aimed at the cultivation of plant species that have an eye-catching application. But the green space including medicinal plants in the university space has both effects on the physical and mental health of people and has a good view. It can also be used for teaching students. Therefore, the architectural style of successful herbal botanical gardens needs to reflect a broad understanding of botany and encourage creative thinking in garden design and interpretation. Medicinal Plants gardens are more than just a \"pleasant place to visit\" because of their unique combination of resources, and it offers a unique opportunity to use plants for human well-being. As a result, the architectural design of the garden may have an impact on its performance. The purpose of this article is to describe the effect of medicinal plants on people's health and education, as well as their architectural design in universities. \u00a9 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Significant differences of contents of soluble solids, total sugars, inverted sugars, sucrose, total phenolic content, content of flavonoids and antioxidant activity were found among cultivar/treatment combinations, cultivars, treatments and years. Differences in total acids content among treatments and years were not statistically significant, but significant differences among cultivars and cultivar/treatment combinations were found. The contents of soluble solids, total sugars and sucrose were the highest in fruits of cultivar Jonagold Decosta, while the highest contents of inverted sugars, total acids, total phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant activity were found in fruits of Red Idared cultivar. The fertilization treatment T2 significantly influenced the content of soluble solids, total sugars, inverted sugars, total acids, total phenolic, flavonoids and antioxidant activity in the apple fruits. According to the results obtained, we can say that fertilization treatment T3 do not have much effect on bioactive ingredients, with the exception of the sucrose content. Among mineral elements, four were macroelements that were represented present in large amounts: potassium (K) (1266.15 mg kg\u20131 to 1652.89 mg kg\u20131), calcium (Ca) (122.76\u2012474.90 mg kg\u20131), phosphor (P) (86.14\u2012124.84 mg kg\u20131) and magnesium (Mg) (57.36\u201270.68 mg kg\u20131). On the other hand, four microelements were determined: boron (B) (1.06\u201214.25 mg kg\u20131); iron (Fe) (2.79\u20124.62 mg kg\u20131); manganese (Mn) (0.27\u20120.46 mg kg\u20131) and zinc (Zn) (0.15\u20120.48 mg kg\u20131).

The Botany Bay Bearded Greenhood, Pterostylis sp. Botany Bay, is an example of a poorly studied plant that is listed as endangered under both Commonwealth and New South Wales legislation. This study reports on archival surveys from 1998 to 2005 conducted at up to eight sites known to contain the Botany Bay Bearded Greenhood and follow-up surveys in 2022. The archival surveys found that the total population count ranged from 83 to 341 individuals. Mean numbers (\u00b1 standard error) of seedlings, flowering individuals and individuals exhibiting capsule development recorded in the population were 43 \u00b1 14, 33 \u00b1 9 and 2 \u00b1 1 respectively. The 2022 surveys did not detect the species. An area of potential habitat was derived from records in biodiversity databases, which determined a total historical extent of 1.38 ha restricted to the Kurnell Peninsula in Sydney, New South Wales. The priority next step is to gather contemporary data to confirm whether the Botany Bay Bearded Greenhood remains extant, which can be done by applied researchers, students, landholders and land managers, botanical practitioners and/or volunteers. For optimal species detection, we recommend undertaking formal surveys or opportunistic searches in historically known sites and replicating detection efforts across July\u2013September periods to exploit seasonal flowering. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

In India, there is less comprehensive information on the potential genetic diversity of lablab bean and this is a major challenge for systematic use of lablab bean in genetic breeding programs. To exploit the available trait of interest, the genetic diversity of the locally available genotypes must be known. The PCR-based SSR approach requires just nanogram amounts of template DNA, subjected to quick detection and less influenced by environment. In this manner SSR have been utilizing broadly to study hereditary assorted qualities of yields. Methods: In this study, genetic diversity on ten Indian Dolichos lablab (L.) genotypes were surveyed utilizing SSR markers at Department of Botany, Bundelkhand University, Jhansi during 2019-20 got from Indian gene bank. For SSR analysis, 5 primers were used for checking the diversity in Dolichos lablab (L.) and the performance of markers were measured by using 4 parameters (1) PIC, (2) Mean resolving power, (3) Resolving power and (4) MI. Result: SSR (05) markers produced a total of 51 bands, out of which 45 bands (88.23%) were polymorphic which varies from 6 (Primer-111) to 15 (Primer-AGB-9) with mean of 10.5 bands per primer. The polymorphic information content value ranges from 0.265 to 0.488 with a mean value of 0.390. The value of Matrix index is 3.2. The value of resolving power ranges from 2.2 to 12.60 with a mean value of 7.40. In the UPGMA dendogram, the 10 genotypes were separated into two main clusters with all the primers used. Our present examination uncovered that genetic markers might be effectively used for deciding hereditary variety and connections in Dolichos lablab (L.) genotypes and could be utilized as a part of breeding programs. \u00a9 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

            "text": "In the conventional view, species are separate gene pools delineated by reproductive isolation (RI). In an alternative view, species may also be delineated by a small set of 'speciation genes' without full RI, a view that has gained broad acceptance. A recent survey, however, suggested that the extensive literature on 'speciation with gene flow' is mostly (if not all) about exchanges in the early stages of speciation. There is no definitive evidence that the observed gene flow actually happened after speciation is completed. Here, we wish to know whether 'good species' (defined by the 'secondary sympatry' test) do continue to exchange genes and, importantly, under what conditions such exchanges can be observed. De novo whole-genome assembly and re-sequencing of individuals across the range of two closely related mangrove species (Rhizophora mucronata and R. stylosa) reveal the genomes to be well delineated in allopatry. They became sympatric in northeastern Australia but remain distinct species. Nevertheless, their genomes harbor \u223c4000-10 000 introgression blocks averaging only about 3-4 Kb. These fine-grained introgressions indicate continual gene flow long after speciation as non-introgressable 'genomic islets,' \u223c1.4 Kb in size, often harbor diverging genes of flower or gamete development. The fine-grained introgression in secondary sympatry may help settle the debate about sympatric vs. micro-allopatric speciation. In conclusion, true 'good species' may often continue to exchange genes but the opportunity for detection is highly constrained. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The samples pollen composition was monitored by optical microscopy. The infrared spectrum of the ethanol extractable material form different pollen samples indicated the specific presence of an aromatic portion in samples dominated by pollens from arboreal species of sweet chestnut pollen grains (e.g. Castanea sativa Mill. and Prunus). In addition, the UPLC-PDA analysis showed the ubiquitarian presence of an array of different derivatives confirmed as hydroxylated cinnamoyl derivatives of spermidine (major) and of spermine (minor). This profile appeared to be associated with the sample botanical origin. Samples dominated by chestnut honey pollen grains showed the highest content in total amount of these derivatives, with a peculiar profile dominated by the presence of N1, N5, N10-tricaffeoyl spermidine. The results showed that their average chemical composition is quantitatively and qualitatively correlated to their botanical origin, suggesting the feasibility of this approach as a practical tool to monitor plant population using honeybee pollen as a bioindicator of the impact of natural and anthropic processes at the local and global level. \u00a9 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF)."

Abstract: Grain yield, thousand-grain weight, screenings and hectolitre weight are important wheat yield traits. An understanding of their genetic basis is crucial for improving grain yield in breeding programmes. Nested association mapping (NAM) populations are useful resources for the dissection of the genetic basis of complex traits such as grain yield and related traits in wheat. Coupled with phenotypic data collected from multiple environments, NAM populations have the power to detect quantitative trait loci and their multiple alleles, providing germplasm that can be incorporated into breeding programmes. In this study, we evaluated a large-scale wheat NAM population with two recurrent parents in unbalanced trials in nine diverse Australian field environments over three years. By applying a single-stage factor analytical linear mixed model (FALMM) to the NAM multi-environment trials (MET) data and conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we detected 98 stable marker-trait associations (MTAs) with their multiple alleles. 74 MTAs had 127 alleles that were derived from the exotic parents and were absent in either of the two recurrent parents. The exotic alleles had favourable effects on 46 MTAs of the 74 MTAs, for grain yield, thousand-grain weight, screenings and hectolitre weight. Two NAM RILs with consistently high yield in multiple environments were also identified, highlighting the potential of the NAM population in supporting plant breeding through provision of germplasm that can be readily incorporated into breeding programmes. The identified beneficial exotic alleles introgressed into the NAM population provide potential target alleles for the genetic improvement of wheat and further studies aimed at pinpointing the underlying genes. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

            "text": "In this study, the drying behavior of cassava starch-based edible films was investigated. Formulations were elaborated with rebaudioside A, glycerol, and low concentrations (0.5, 2, and 4%, w/w) of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil.) extract (YM%). Physicochemical properties (pH, apparent viscosity, and density) and film-forming capacity (dip-coating method) were evaluated at 25\u00b0C. Films were casted by drying and mathematically described using the Henderson and Pabis thin-layer model. Effective moisture diffusion coefficients (Deff) were determined using theoretical film thicknesses evaluated at the critical moisture content. The Deff dependency on temperature and YM% was analyzed using an Arrhenius-type model. Based on the results, as YM% increased, values of pH, and apparent viscosity decreased. Low YM% increased the drying rates and the values of Deff of cassava starch-based edible films elaborated with rebaudioside A as a sweetener and bioactive compound, obtaining the highest values at 4% (w/w) and 70\u00b0C. Novelty impact statement: The optimization and control of the drying process are important to produce coated foods with high-quality and nutritional value in the industry. Yerba mate extract powder added to cassava starch-based formulations at low concentrations (<5%, w/w) is suitable for obtaining edible films and coatings with higher drying rates and effective moisture diffusion coefficients that control film casting due to the better hydrophobicity and plasticizing effect. This information could be useful to manufacture new film-forming fluids with bioactive compounds (e.g., rebaudioside A), such as alternative bio-packages that allow to replace the disposable composite synthetic plastic containers, and products for people with special diet requirements due to its low or sugar-free nature. \u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

More than 523 million cases of coronavirus disease (COVID19), a recent respiratory diseases have been reported, leaving more than 6 million deaths worldwide since the start of the pandemic. In Zimbabwe, respiratory infections have largely been managed using traditional (herbal) medicines, due to their low cost and ease of accessibility. This review highlights the plants\u2019 toxicological and pharmacological evaluation studies explored. It seeks to document plants that have been traditionally used in Zimbabwe to treat respiratory ailments within and beyond the past four decades. Extensive literature review based on published papers and abstracts retrieved from the online bibliographic databases, books, book chapters, scientific reports and theses available at Universities in Zimbabwe, were used in this study. From the study, there were at least 58 plant families comprising 160 medicinal plants widely distributed throughout the country. The Fabaceae family had the highest number of medicinal plant species, with a total of 21 species. A total of 12 respiratory ailments were reportedly treatable using the identified plants. From a total of 160 plants, colds were reportedly treatable with 56, pneumonia 53, coughs 34, chest pain and related conditions 29, asthma 25, tuberculosis and spots in lungs 22, unspecified respiratory conditions 20, influenza 13, bronchial problems 12, dyspnoea 7, sore throat and infections 5 and sinus clearing 1 plant. The study identified potential medicinal plants that can be utilised in future to manage respiratory infections. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

This provides opportunities for the valorisation of the stem\u2019s residual xylemic core (hemp hurd). This study investigated the effect of particle dimension and constituent proportions on the internal bond strength (IB) of single-layer, ultra-low-density hemp hurd particleboard (ULHPB) with densities between 219 to 304 kg/m3. Particle size distributions (PSD) and granulometry assessments were conducted on three particle size classes (fine (F), medium (M), coarse (C)) based on digital image analysis using ImageJ. Subsequently, four particle size mixes (100% C, 100% M, 50/50% CM, 25/50/25% CMF) were considered for the ULHPB manufacture with bio-epoxy (EPX), phenol resorcinol formaldehyde (PRF) and emulsifiable methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) adhesives, respectively. The effect of particle loading and adhesive content varied significantly per adhesive type. Internal bond (IB) performance increased in most ULHPB comprising coarse particles and declined with the addition of smaller particle sizes. The granulometry assessment showed the smallest mean elongation amongst particles in the coarse PSD. The IB results confirmed a strong interdependence of particle size and constituent proportions and indicated that various MDI-ULHPB variants can surpass the minimum IB strength requirement of 0.30 MPa stipulated for standard particleboard (>12\u201322 mm) in AS/NZS 1859.1. Utilising residual hemp biomass as an alternative, renewable lignocellulosic feedstock in the manufacture of engineered lightweight panel products is a key principle of circular economy and an environmentally friendly strategy to address the increasing resource scarcity in the wood-based panel industry. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Hence, the requirements for seedlings\u2019 growth need to be addressed before replanting degraded sites. The present study determines the effect of abiotic factors viz. light irradiance (8%, 30%, and 100%), nutrient addition (no fertiliser (NF), NPK, and vermicompost) on the growth performance and photosynthetic capacity of two dipterocarp species seedlings, Shorea leprosula Miq. and Shorea acuminata Dyer. The morphological characteristics assessed for growth performance comprised plant height, stem diameter, leaf count, leaf area, relative chlorophyll concentration, biomass, and root-to-shoot ratio. Li-Cor 6400 and 6800 were used to measure the leaf gas exchange traits, including photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration rate (E), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), stomatal conductance (gsw), and water-use efficiency (WUE). Our results demonstrated that different levels of light intensity and nutrient amendment significantly impacted plant-growth performance. Plants grown in 30% irradiance showed better growth performance in terms of relative height growth rate (RHGR), mean number of leaves, and leaf areas 41%, 24%, and 32% higher than the control. The A value was also higher in 30% irradiance, but no significant differences were observed between each level of light irradiance. The addition of vermicompost gave better growth for RHGR, relative diameter growth rate (RDGR), mean number of leaves, biomass, and relative chlorophyll concentrations 47%, 40%, 131%, 19%, and 27% higher than the control, respectively. However, the results obtained for photosynthetic parameters were contrary to growth performance. The photosynthesis rate (A) was higher (14.8%) in NPK compared to the control, and the other photosynthetic parameters did not differ significantly despite different nutrient amendments. In terms of species, S. leprosula has better growth performance and photosynthetic characteristics than S. acuminata in different light irradiance and nutrient amendments, thereby rendering S. leprosula the preferred rehabilitation species. Generally, nutrient addition of either NPK or vermicompost and 30% light irradiance gave better morphological and physiological growth for both species. The outcome of this study could provide a better understanding on the forest rehabilitation strategy to reduce the seedling-mortality rate, particularly for climax tree species. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Among the variety of studied anode materials, hard carbons appear to be the realistic candidates because of their electrochemical performance and relative ease of production. This class of materials can be obtained from a variety of precursors, and the most ecologically important and interesting route is the synthesis from biomass. In the present work, for the first time, hard carbons were obtained from Heracleum sosnowskyi, a highly invasive plant, which is dangerous for humans and can cause skin burns but produces a large amount of green biomass in a short time. We proposed a simple synthesis method that includes the pretreatment stage and further carbonization at 1300 \u00b0C. The effect of the pretreatment of giant hogweed on the hard carbon electrochemical properties was studied. Obtained materials demonstrate >220 mAh g\u22121 of the discharge capacity, high values of the initial Coulombic efficiency reaching 87% and capacity retention of 95% after 100 charge-discharge cycles in sodium half-cells. Key parameters of the materials were examined by means of different analytical, spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The possibility of using the giant hogweed-based hard carbons in real batteries is demonstrated with full sodium-ion cells with NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode material. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

These changes are predicted to continue, jeopardizing the survival of medicinal plant species and local livelihoods that rely on them. We analyzed the present and future diversity and distribution of medicinal plant species influenced by different climate change scenarios, and calculated the climatic niche of the species using ensemble species distribution modeling (eSDM). We compiled 1041 (N) geospatial data of seven high-value medicinal plant species of Nepal: Aconitum spicatum (n = 100), Allium wallichii (n = 151), Bergenia ciliata (n = 48), Nardostachys jatamansi (n = 121), Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora (n = 94), Paris polyphylla (n = 310) and Valeriana jatamansi (n = 217) including over 85 % from field surveys and the rest from literature and online database. We used bioclimatic variables from Models for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) of version MIROC6, and selected Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 for the year of 2050 and 2070 for modeling. We found elevation, mean diurnal and annual temperature ranges (BIO2 and BIO7), and precipitation of warmest and coldest quarters (BIO18 and BIO19) to be the most high weight cofactors for projecting the future potential distribution of high-value medicinal plants in Nepal. Results showed that the suitable range of distribution for high-value medicinal plants would increase and concentrate in mountainous areas of central Nepal, but decline in (sub)tropical and temperate areas, suggesting both in-situ and ex-situ conservation practices, respectively. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)"

An urban area was established from which soil samples were taken and analyses were performed on the content of heavy metal ions. The soil samples were collected from Iasi\u2019s urban area to determine the heavy metal concentrations, obtain maps of sensitive land, and determine the content of heavy metals in spontaneous flora and transfer these into an aqueous extract. The investigation of heavy metal ion levels in certain plants revealed the following: (i) all plants from the Brassicaceae accumulate heavy metals, and B. juncea has a great ability to accumulate and transfer Cu, Cr(VI), Cd, Ni, Pb, and Zn towards the shoots; (ii) heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn) were present in variable concentrations, with mint and nettle being notable for their increased level of iron and thyme, and rattle for its zinc levels; (iii) toxic metals (Pb, Cd, Ni) are present in low concentrations in plants as well as in infusions, except for in primula and plantain, which do not have high levels of Pb and Cd. The results showed that values exceeded the maximum recommended values in areas with industrial pollution. Taking into account the potential for the bioaccumulation of heavy metal ions by plants from spontaneous flora and their use as medicinal plants, it is recommended, based on the studies conducted, to harvest and use plants from soils that do not contain heavy metal ions. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Plants are able to detect water through various stimuli, including changes in moisture levels and changes in water potential. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of how root movement towards water and plant water uptake are stabilized. The impact of hydrotropism on plants can be significant. It can help plants to survive in environments where water is scarce, and it can also help them to grow more efficiently by directing their roots towards the most nutrient-rich soil. To make sure that plant growth and water uptake are stabilized, plants must sense water. Flowing down the roots, being absorbed by roots, and evaporating from the leaves are all processes that are governed by plant physiology and soil science. Soil texture and moisture affect water uptake. Hydraulic resistances can impede plants\u2019 water absorption, while loss of water and water movement can change plants\u2019 water potential gradients. Growth causes water potential gradients. Plants respond to gradient changes. Stomata and aquaporins govern water flow and loss. When water is scarce, stomatal closure and hydraulic conductance adjustments prevent water loss. Plants adapt to water stream changes by expanding their roots towards water and refining the architecture of their roots. Our study indicates that water availability, or gradients, are impacted by systemic and local changes in water availability. The amount of water available is reflected in plant turgor. There is still a lot of work to be done regarding the study of how the loss and availability of water affect plant cells, as well as how biophysical signals are transformed in a certain way during their transmission into chemical signals so that pathways such as abscisic acid response or organ development can be fed with information. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Molecular markers were established to distinguish between the two plants using quantitative real-time PCR. Species-specific primers were designed in the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA and in the chloroplast genes matK, rbcL, and rpoB. Six primer sets were tested, the correlation coefficient was higher than 0.99, and the slope was approximately \u2212 3.36 to \u2212 3.58. Efficiency ranged from 90.13 to 98.52%. The developed real-time PCR assay was validated with 14 off-target species, and its reliability was verified through blind testing of 14 commercial products. The assay developed here may help protect consumer rights, and the designed primers can be used to distinguish between the target species. \u00a9 2022, The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology."

Haploid technique increases the selection efficiency for developing resistant bottle gourd varieties. This work focused on haploid induction in bottle gourd through in situ parthenogenesis by pollination with gamma-irradiated pollen. Pollination were carried out for six genotypes of bottle gourd with 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150\u00a0Gy (Gy) doses of gamma rays. Production of in vitro haploid plants was influenced by irradiation dose, genotype and embyo stage. Seeds at 17 to 21 days after pollination was found to be optimum for embryo rescue. Pollination with irradiated pollen at 100 to 125\u00a0Gy was effective for haploid induction. The ploidy level of the 11 parthenogenetic plantlets was confirmed by flow cytometry and 36.3% haploid and 9% triploid plantlets were obtained.

As forensic palynology is not carried out in Croatia at all, the main aims of our work were to establish an initial palynological collection for a limited area in Croatia and deter-mine its forensic potential. Materials and Methods: For our case study, we chose a typical town from continental Croatia, Donja Stubica, in which there had been no pre-vious floristic studies. The field survey was conducted during 2005, 2007, and 2021. Floristic and palynological analysis was carried out with an emphasis on the forensic potential of pollen grains. Results: A total of 141 representative plant taxa with pollen samples were collected. The taxonomic analysis showed that the area for the case study was chosen well. Palynological analysis showed that the highest number of taxa had pollen grains that were spheroidal in shape (60%), medium sized (70%), and colporate (41%). The pollen of the majority of taxa had excellent or very important forensic potential, due to their dispersal by insects (60%), a combination of two dispersal methods (23%), and autogamy (1%). In addition, due to the limited distribution of certain rare plants (e.g., Iris sibirica subsp. sibirica in Croatia), their pollen has an even greater forensic potential than the similar pollen of related, more widespread taxa. Conclusion: The generated palynological collection, due to the great forensic potential, could be used in the future as a comparative, and at least partly as a reference forensic collection, applicable in specific cases of legal pollen expertise in Croatia. \u00a9 2023, Croatian Society of Natural Sciences.

            "text": "Modern timber engineering requires increasing application of the finite element method (FEM). In such analyses, the elastic constants including the Poisson's ratios are required. The latter have mostly been neglected so far, since these vary to a great degree in related literature. Hence, an experimental method based on compression tests was developed and benchmarked on numerous preliminary tests in order to determine the Poisson's ratios on spruce wood (Picea Abies). For the first time, the extended measurement uncertainty was taken into account. On the basis of these values, a comparison with values from literature was conducted. Several observations indicate that, in addition to the wood properties, the load application as well as the test setup have a significant influence on the Poisson's ratios. In summary, all obtained values lie in the medium range of the literature values. Consequently, the developed test method for determining the Poisson's ratios is considered to be suitable. In addition, an expanded Poisson's ratio was determined taking into account the measurement uncertainty in order to obtain a symmetrical compliance matrix. \u00a9 2023 13th World Conference on Timber Engineering, WCTE 2023.

            "text": "Background: In vitro growth and development of plants in the micropropagation stages are influenced by several factors, including the light spectral quality, which has shown important effects on the photomorphogenesis. The work aimed to evaluate the photomorphogenic effect of spectral qualities on in vitro culture of Eucalyptus dunnii and Eucalyptusgrandis x E. urophylla. Methods: Six light spectral qualities (i.e., red, white, blue, yellow, purple, and green) on in vitro multiplication, elongation, and adventitious rooting stages were evaluated through analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's test. Results: White spectral quality was most adequate for in vitro multiplication of Eucalyptus dunnii and Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla, as it resulted in less tissue oxidation, longer shoot length, and more buds per explant. Red, blue and yellow spectral qualities increased the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll (a+b) leaf contents of Eucalyptus dunnii. To promote in vitro elongation, white spectral quality was most suitable for Eucalyptus dunnii, and yellow for Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla, as these resulted in more shoot length and shoots per explant. Red, white, blue and purple spectral qualities increased the stomatal density of Eucalyptus dunnii; while the white and yellow were the better for Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla. To promote in vitro rooting, the white and yellow spectral qualities caused the best results for the Eucalyptus dunnii and Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla, with longer root length and more roots per explant. Eucalyptus dunnii showed reduced adventitious rooting, regardless of spectral quality. Conclusions: Light quality influence the morphophysiological responses of Eucalyptus in different stages of in vitro culture. Our results contribute to maximise the in vitro cloning of important eucalypts species. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023. Open Access."

Previously, some metal salts have been proven to depolymerize hemicellulose into xylose at low doses. However, few metal salts have been reported for the production of XOS from lignocelluloses. In this study, FeCl3 hydrolysis and FeCl2 hydrolysis of switchgrass were compared to produce XOS, then FeCl3-hydrolyzed switchgrass was delignified by sodium perborate (SPB) pretreatment for producing monosaccharides. The results showed that the highest XOS (DP 2-6) yield\u00a0of 40.7% was obtained from switchgrass by 25\u00a0mM FeCl3 hydrolysis at 160\u00a0\u00b0C for 50\u00a0min. A high lignin removal (75.5%) and glucan retention (90.5%) of FeCl3-hydrolyzed switchgrass was obtained by 8% SPB pretreatment at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. After cellulase (20 FPU/g dry mass) hydrolysis of SPB-pretreated switchgrass, 87.5% glucose, and 95.0% xylose were obtained. The results suggest that FeCl3 hydrolysis combined with SPB pretreatment is an efficient and novel method for producing XOS and monosaccharides from switchgrass under relatively mild conditions.

The present study was planned to find out the potential roles, mechanisms and applications of luffa rootstock to improve salt tolerance of grafted cucumber plants. Here, we screened a highly salt-tolerant luffa rootstock by evaluating the growth, photosynthetic performance, antioxidant defense and the accumulation of Na+ and K+ under salt stress. Reciprocal grafting between cucumber and luffa showed that luffa rootstock significantly improved the salt tolerance of cucumber plants, as evidenced by higher fresh weight, photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), and lower relative electrical conductivity (REC), which was closely associated with the decreased accumulation of Na+ and increased the accumulation of K+ in shoots of luffa grafted cucumber seedlings, leading to a lower Na+:K+ ratio in shoot when compared with self-grafted cucumber. Furthermore, grafting with intermediate stock of luffa also sufficiently alleviated cucumber salt stress by reducing Na+ accumulation in shoot and the whole plant but increasing Na+ accumulation in interstock and root under salt stress, fully proving the salt tolerance depending on the capacity of luffa interstock to limit the transport of Na+ from the root to the shoot. More importantly, luffa rootstock improved the growth, yield and quality of grafted cucumber plants grown in pots in solar greenhouse as revealed by increased net photosynthetic rate, plant height, leaf number, yield, Vitamin C and soluble sugar but decreased titratable acid under both salinity and normal conditions. Together, these results, for the first time, clearly demonstrated that luffa,a new highly salt-tolerant rootstock, enhances salt tolerance and improves yield and quality of grafted cucumber plants by reducing sodium transport to the shoot. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

            "text": "Bioluminescence imaging has advantages over fluorescence imaging, such as minimal photobleaching and autofluorescence, and greater signal-to-noise ratios in many complex environments. Although significant achievements have been made in luciferase engineering for generating bright and stable reporters, the full capability of luciferases for nanoparticle tracking has not been comprehensively examined. In biocatalysis, enhanced enzyme performance after immobilization on nanoparticles has been reported. Thus, we hypothesized that by assembling luciferases onto a nanoparticle, the resulting complex could lead to substantially improved imaging properties. Using a modular bioconjugation strategy, we attached NanoLuc (NLuc) or Akaluc bioluminescent proteins to a protein nanoparticle platform (E2), yielding nanoparticles NLuc-E2 and Akaluc-E2, both with diameters of \u223c45 \u200bnm. Although no significant differences were observed between different conditions involving Akaluc and Akaluc-E2, free NLuc at pH 5.0 showed significantly lower emission values than free NLuc at pH 7.4. Interestingly, NLuc immobilization on E2 nanoparticles (NLuc-E2) emitted increased luminescence at pH 7.4, and at pH 5.0 showed over two orders of magnitude (>200-fold) higher luminescence (than free NLuc), expanding the potential for imaging detection using the nanoparticle even upon endocytic uptake. After uptake by macrophages, the resulting luminescence with NLuc-E2 nanoparticles was up to 7-fold higher than with free NLuc at 48 \u200bh. Cells incubated with NLuc-E2 could also be imaged using live bioluminescence microscopy. Finally, biodistribution of nanoparticles into lymph nodes was detected through imaging using NLuc-E2, but not with conventionally-labeled fluorescent E2. Our data demonstrate that NLuc-bound nanoparticles have advantageous properties that can be utilized in applications ranging from single-cell imaging to in vivo biodistribution. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

            "text": "In the last 500 million years, Earth's biota experienced periods of crises with extinctions on a large scale and significant turnover events, one of them being the Permian/Triassic boundary extinction event. The following Early Triassic was a critical time marked by a series of biological and environmental changes with a complex recovery pattern of marine faunas and ecosystems. Generally, animals and plants respond to stress by using different strategies that help them tolerate or recover from unfavourable environmental conditions. In this contribution, we quantitatively and qualitatively describe a variety of malformations of spores and pollen grains from the extensively studied Nammal section (Salt Range, Pakistan) across the Smithian/Spathian boundary interval (Early Triassic). High dominance of malformed sporomorphs is recorded throughout the studied interval, indicating stressful conditions for plants on the Indian margin during the Early Triassic. One of the highest abundances of malformed sporomorphs coincides with the spore spike and the negative carbon isotope excursion during the middle Smithian, emphasising this intense biotic stress. Either a cocktail of volcanic gases, acid rains, soil acidification, and heavy metal pollution as a consequence of a late pulse of the Siberian Traps large igneous province or climatic extremes might have been responsible for these malformations. Here teratology is used as a tool/means to assess the severity of biotic crises in the plant kingdom, indicating its potential value as a signal of ecological disturbance. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

It is widely considered to be one of the most significant pulse crops farmed in India. Anthracnose, Leaf Crinkle, Powdery Mildew and Yellow Mosaic diseases shown significant impact on the black gram production and causing financial loss to the farmers. A fusion of image processing and computer vison algorithms are widely used in recent years, for applications in the diagnosis and categorization of diseases that affect plant leaves. To detect and classify plant leaf diseases which degrades the quality of the black gram crop, in early stages, using computer vision algorithms, a Black gram Plant Leaf Disease (BPLD) dataset was created and briefly discussed in this article. The dataset holds a total of 1000 images belongs to five classes: four diseases and one healthy. The images in the presented dataset were captured under the real cultivation fields at Nagayalanka, Krishna, Andhra Pradesh, using camera and mobile phones. After the image acquisition, the images were categorized and processed with the help of agriculture experts. Researchers who utilize image processing, machine learning and particularly deep learning algorithms for automated diagnosis and classification of black gram plant leaf diseases in early stage to assist farmers could benefit from this dataset.

It is a field that requires prior knowledge of the target species, in addition to correct identification and taxonomic description. In botany, the identification of plant species traditionally relies on key morphological descriptions and anatomical features. However, in complex species and tree plants, molecular identification can facilitate identification and increase species delimitation accuracy. In the Faifa mountains of Jazan province in Saudi Arabia, 12 rarely occurring plants were recorded and identified using two DNA barcoding regions (i.e., rbcL and ITS). All the samples were successfully amplified, sequenced, and analyzed using the standard DNA barcode protocol, and this resulted in the clear and accurate identification of 11 out of the 12 sampled species. A total of five species were in agreement in terms of both morpho- and molecular-based identification. Four and two species were identified based solely on ITS and rbcL phylogenetics, respectively. The geographic distribution records of the identified species showed that some species were distributed at a distance far from their usual region, while others were reported in proximate regions and localities. Some species were found to be medicinally important and required additional conservation plans. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

The results showed that the combination of BL and SA noticeably delayed weight loss, prevented decay, improved fruit skin brightness, and increased soluble protein. Strawberries treated with BL + SA had lower total soluble solids and titratable acidity contents among treatments but had no significant change during the entire storage. Additionally, contents of total flavonoids, phenolics, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and total antioxidant capacities in BL + SA-treated fruit were kept at stable levels throughout the entire storage. Collectively, these findings suggest that BL + SA treatment exhibits a high potential in maintaining postharvest fruit quality of strawberry fruit. \u00a9 2022"

P. granatum leaf extract was employed as a capping and stabilizing agent for the formation of silica nanoparticles, which were synthesized by a biological method using tetra ethyl ortho silicate. Biosynthesized silica nanoparticles are characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. All the analyses and characterization determined that the particles were spherical in shape and amorphous in nature with an average size of 12\u00a0nm. P. granatum-assisted silica nanoparticles were tested for antibacterial activity by a well-diffusion method against two-gram negative bacterial pathogens (E. coli and Salmonella sp.). The antibacterial studies prove that P. granatum-assisted silica nanoparticles have good antibacterial properties. These studies will help us find a new nano-drug or medicine against multidrug-resistant bacteria. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

            "text": "Recent advances in remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have provided an exciting and promising opportunity for estimating gross primary production (GPP). Previous studies mainly focused on the linear correlation between SIF and GPP and the slope of the SIF-GPP relationship, both of which lack rigorous consideration of the seasonal trajectories of SIF and GPP. Here, we investigated the timing of seasonal peaks of far-red SIF and GPP in soybean fields by integrating tower data, satellite data, and process-based Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE, v2.0) model simulations. We found inconsistency between the seasonal peak timing of far-red SIF and GPP in three of four soybean fields based on tower far-red SIF and eddy-covariance measurements. In particular, far-red SIF reached its seasonal maximum 14\u201317 days earlier than GPP. This far-red SIF-GPP difference in peak timing degraded the correlation between sunny-day far-red SIF and GPP at daily scale (Pearson r = 0.83\u20130.87 at the site with 14\u201317 days difference and Pearson r = 0.96 at the site with no difference), and it can be explained by a divergence in the seasonality between absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) and canopy chlorophyll content (ChlCanopy). We found that the seasonality of far-red SIF - a byproduct of the light reactions of photosynthesis - was primarily controlled by APAR, whereas GPP seasonality was dominated by ChlCanopy. Further, SCOPE model simulations showed that the seasonal patterns of leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (ChlLeaf) and leaf angle distribution (LAD) could affect the different peak timing of SIF and GPP and consequently the seasonal relationship between far-red SIF and GPP. A further increase in LAI after the fraction of light absorption (FPAR) saturates and a later peak of ChlLeaf compared to LAI results in a later peak of GPP compared to far-red SIF. More horizontal leaf angles can further exacerbate this difference. Our results advance mechanistic understanding of the SIF-GPP relationships and combining chlorophyll content information with SIF could potentially improve remote-sensing-based GPP estimation. \u00a9 2022"

            "text": "Drought is one of the major constraints for sustainable crop production worldwide, especially in arid and semiarid regions. The global warming and climate change scenario has worsened the dilemma of water scarcity, creating an immediate threat to food security. Conserving water resources and exploiting various strategies that enable plants to withstand water deficits need to be urgently addressed. Drought adversely affects plant growth by modulating a range of physio-chemical, metabolic, and molecular processes inside the plant body, which ultimately reduces crop productivity. Besides developing drought-tolerant cultivars, better nutrient management could be a promising strategy to enhance drought tolerance in crop plants. Silicon, a quasi-essential element, is known to play a vital role in improving crop performance under a range of biotic and abiotic stresses. This review discusses the potential of Si application in attenuating the adverse effects of water-deficit stress. Silicon enhances plant growth by improving seed germination, cell membrane stability, carbon assimilation, plant\u2013water relations and osmotic adjustment (by accumulating soluble sugars, proline and glycine betaine). It triggers the activity of antioxidants, promotes the biosynthesis of phytohormones, enhances nutrient acquisition and regulates the activity of vital enzymes in plants under drought stress. Silicon also induces anatomical changes in the plant cell wall through the deposition of polymerized amorphous silica (SiO2-nH2O), thereby improving stem and leaf erectness and reducing lodging. Further, Si-mediated physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms associated with drought tolerance in plants and future research prospects have been elucidated. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) are major substrates for plant metabolism and play an important role in seedling survival and growth under drought conditions. Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb.), a constructive species distributed in northeast China, has a high drought tolerance. However, studies on seedling growth and the NSC dynamics of Mongolian oak under different drought intensities and durations are limited. To investigate this, our study measured photosynthetic characteristics, growth, biomass, and NSC concentrations for Mongolian oak seedlings on the 0, 15th, 30th, 45th, and 60th day of the experiment under three soil moisture conditions [75% \u00b1 5% (CK), 50% \u00b1 5% (W1), and 23% \u00b1 5% (W2) of soil moisture field capacity (FC)]. Results showed that the growth and biomass gradually decreased as the soil moisture decreased, but the root: shoot ratio and root biomass allocation ratio gradually increased. In the W1 treatment (moderate drought), NSC content in the stems and taproots was 7.42% and 16.39% higher than those in CK at 60 days. However, in W2 treatment (severe drought), NSC content in the stems and taproots was significantly higher than those in CK during the whole period (p < 0.05), and they were 14.14% and 26.69% higher than those in CK at 60 days. We found that, under drought stress, Mongolian oak seedlings had lower growth but higher allocation to root biomass and higher NSC content in stems and roots. Furthermore, the root system became a vital carbon sink under drought stress and was beneficial for seedling survival. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

The main focus is to comprehensively analyze the effects of diverse forest and agroforestry biomass, pyrolysis temperature (350, 450 and 550 \u00b0C) and heating rate (2, 10 and 30 \u00b0C min\u22121) on the yield of the products biochar, bio-oil and permanent gas, and on the composition of biochar and permanent gas. This analysis provides a valuable collection of insights to support the advancement of pyrolysis projects and their expansion into industrial production, facilitating the creation of versatile products. The study showed that the biochar, bio-oil and permanent gas yields were between 0.22 and 0.47, 0.26 and 0.59 and 0.17 and 0.41 kg kg\u22121 dry biomass, respectively. The pyrolysis of olive pomace has the maximum biochar yield, that of eucalyptus sawdust has the maximum bio-oil yield, and that of giant reed has the maximum permanent gas yield. The increased temperature led to a decreased biochar yield and an increased bio-oil yield. The increased heating rate led to a decreased biochar yield and an increased bio-oil yield. Biochar has a carbon content above 0.7 kg kg\u22121 dry ash free, with an LHV between 24.2 and 30.5 MJ kg\u22121 dry biochar, suggesting potential for soil enrichment and the energy vector. Permanent gas has an LHV between 5.4 and 9.7 MJ Nm\u22123, and seems useful as a thermal energy source to support the pyrolysis process. \u00a9 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

In recent decades, various extraction methods, such as cold pressing, supercritical CO2 extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, liquid and gas chromatography, hydro-distillation method, Soxhlet extraction, alcohol extraction, steam distillation, and accelerated solvent extraction have been used for extraction under optimal conditions. Microgreens contain essential bioactive compounds which work as functional foods because these microgreens are produced and cut down before ripening. Since these are the tiny cotyledons of different pulses, grains, and vegetable seeds, they possess different nutritional profile than whole one which contains essential fatty acids, in which major one is linoleic acid and functional compounds as important antioxidant enzymes like glucoraphanin which signals the antioxidants, glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, anthocyanins, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase which work against inflammation and oxidative stress and so work against chronic diseases like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Many clinical and experimental studies have indicated that microgreens of different species fenugreek, brassica, black mustard, mung beans, green peas, red cabbage, and broccoli can be used to reduce the risk of metabolic disorders, goiter, kidney diseases, and other chronic illnesses.

            "text": "Vertical farming, a terminology in landscape architecture, is designed to cater for the demand of vegetation under the impact of excessive exploid of land, especially in densely-populated areas. The study takes vertical farming in Singapore as an example, applies 3D modeling to investigate the effect of different arrangement patterns on plant light absorption in vertical farms, and proposes some measures. Through the 3D simulation process, each square of the soil for planting can be quantified in sunlight-exposure hour. The experiment result shows that configuration with an array piling up is judicious and feasible for greenhouse growth, especially for commercial usages. Different configurations of plants influence the efficiency of utilizing sunlight, and there is a better layout for a particular site in different usages. For some cities far away from tropical areas, this configuration may alleviate the impact of lacking sunlight exposure. The main advantage of vertical farms is efficiency, as they require less land and water with more yield per acre compared to conventional farms.  \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

This method incorporates a simple look-ahead inspired by Dollo\u2019s law, while simultaneously reconstructing each ancestor (sometimes referred to as hypothetical taxonomic units \u201cHTU\u201d). We first present a generic version of the algorithm illustrating a necessary consequence of Dollo characters. In a concrete application we use generalized oriented gene adjacencies and maximum weight matching (MWM) to reconstruct fragments of monoploid ancestral genomes as HTUs. This is applied to three flowering plant orders while estimating phylogenies for these orders in the process. We discuss how to improve on the extensive computing times that would be necessary for this method to handle larger trees. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s)."

This study focuses on the mechanism of myocardial protection with KR and whether myocardial protection can be achieved by activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (sirtuin) (AMPK/SIRT1) signal pathway. Molecular docking technique was used to predict the binding affinity of KR to AMPK. The inflammatory injury model of H9c2 cells was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. H9c2 cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8 assay. The apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry. Levels of interlukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were determined by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. AMPK and SIRT1 expression levels were quantified through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting assay. Results indicated that KR has a certain binding affinity with AMPK. KR could increase the growth of H9c2 inhibited by LPS, reduce apoptosis rate, and reverse the elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, KR could suppress the expression levels of AMPK and SIRT1, and AMPK-specific inhibitor (Compound C) could significantly counteract the activation of KR, indicating that its anti-inflammatory effect is achieved by regulating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway.  \u00a9 2023 Codon Publications."

Virtual alternatives that could be used to meet learning outcomes for botany (e.g. plant identification, surveying skills development) were largely unavailable at this time. To address this, a semi-immersive virtual botanical fieldtrip was developed using H5P. The resource consists of a 360 site tour, an interactive book with a series of interactive videos to mimic quadrat analysis and plant identification, and a plant identification guide to aid students in identifying species. Students responded largely positively to the resource, although they had a clear preference to undertake fieldwork in person in a more traditional manner. The resource is the first such virtual botanical fieldtrip and allows the retention of most learning outcomes for a traditional field class. This type of resource has considerable potential in a post-pandemic world to widen participation and let students experience ecosystems that they might otherwise not have the opportunity to investigate.

Although they had similar medical effects, the difference between these varieties was verified in this study. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was used to determine their chemical composition. P. sibiricum has seven chemical components, whereas P. odoratum has only five. Based on the DPPH radical scavenging activity analysis results, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of P. sibiricum and P. odoratum were 4.23 and 18.3 mg/mL, respectively. The results of ABTS+ radical scavenging activity analysis showed that the IC50 values of P. sibiricum and P. odoratum were 4.77 and 19.3 mg/mL, respectively. Moreover, P. sibiricum had higher total phenolic content (10.0 mg of gallic acid / g of extract), and better reducing ability than P. odoratum. Again, P. sibiricum showed better tyrosinase inhibition ability than P. odoratum, and the IC50 values were 9.68 and 15.4 mg/mL, respectively. P. sibiricum was concluded to have better biofunctionality than P. odoratum. \u00a9 2023, North Carolina State University. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study was to compare the content of polyphenols in the peels, flesh, seeds and leaves of five apple cultivars (\u2018Antonovka\u2019, \u2018\u00c5ker\u00f6\u2019, \u2018Cortland\u2019, \u2018Karksi renett\u2019 and \u2018Krista\u2019) grown in Estonia. Of the 21 collected cultivars, these five were selected on the basis of their rich or distinct chemical composition according to the LC-DAD-MS/MS data. In addition, the weight of the fruit, the number of seeds in the fruit and the weight of the seeds were determined. A total of 33 compounds were detected in the peels, 23 in the flesh, 11 in the seeds, and 25 in the leaves. They belong to four groups: 1) flavon-3-ols (quercetin and its derivatives), 2) dihydrochalcones (phloretin and its derivatives), 3) flavan-3-ols (catechin, epicatechin and oligomers), and 4) esters formed between caffeic acid and L-quinic acid (chlorogenic acid). Based on the data presented in this article, the leaves contained the highest measured total polyphenol content (TPGA). The peels contained high amounts of all the major polyphenolic groups mentioned. The apple flesh lacked flavon-3-ols and the seeds flavon-3-ols and flavan-3-ols. In the peels, the major polyphenols were quercetin galactoside (3\u2013342 mg/100 g), procyanidin B1 (18\u2013179 mg/100 g), and (epi)catechin trimer (28\u2013200 mg/100 g); in the flesh chlorogenic acid (77\u2013298 mg/100 g); in the seeds phloridzin (466 mg/100 g in \u2018Cortland\u2019); and in the leaves chlorogenic acid (147\u2013446 mg/100 g) and quercetin glycosides, especially quercetin rhamnoside (242\u2013350 mg/100 g), quercetin galactoside (39\u2013 334 mg/100 g) and quercetin glucoside (91\u2013321 mg/100 g). \u00a9 2023 Authors."

Their significance arises from diverse biological activities (anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-cancer, anti-atherogenic, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, etc.) which have been well-documented and point out to the natural-origin, non-toxic compounds for the use in disease prevention and treatment. Nonetheless, iridoids are scarce in edible fruits and are not perceived as important phytocompounds of dietary fruits and food products. However, they do occur in some common edible fruits\u2013olive, noni, berries, and a few less-common, but unique fruits\u2013Japanese cornel, cornelian cherry, kousa dogwood, haskap berry, and guelder rose. In this review, we present the current state of knowledge regarding the identification and content of iridoids in edible fruits, their predominant activities, and above all, the possibilities and effects of iridoids\u2019 application in foods, drinks, and pharmaceuticals. The consulted literature shows that iridoids or iridoid-rich fruits can be successfully applied to broaden the variety of foods, as functional additives, and possibly as future pharmaceuticals of natural origin. Therefore, iridoids deserve an important role in a healthy diet and disease prevention. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Biotechnological contributions to enhancing this crop, its advances, and present issues must be assessed regularly. Functional genomics, genomic-assisted breeding, molecular tools, and genome editing technologies, among other biotechnological approaches, have helped improve the potential of economically important crops like cassava by addressing some of its significant constraints, such as nutrient deficiency, toxicity, poor starch quality, disease susceptibility, low yield capacity, and postharvest deterioration. However, the development, improvement, and subsequent acceptance of the improved cultivars have been challenging and have required holistic approaches to solving them.

            "text": "This paper describes for the first time a complete characterization and quantification of the phenolic compounds in raw and heat-treated northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) seeds using UHPLC-DAD-ESI-HRMS/MS. A total 42 phenolic compounds belonging to five different groups of compounds, including ellagitannins, gallotannins, phenolic glycosides, hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives (HBA derivatives) and ellagic acid derivatives (EA derivatives), were identified, and most of them were reported in Q. rubra seeds for the first time. Significant variability of phenolic composition existed among raw and roasted samples under different temperature and time conditions. The total content of the phenolics, ellagitannins, gallotannins and phenolic glycosides was drastically reduced by roasting, regardless of the thermal processing conditions. In turn, an increase the roasting temperature from 135\u00b0 to 200\u00b0C led to an increment in the total content of HBA and EA derivatives. Among the roasted seeds, the highest total phenolics content was found in the samples thermally treated at 185 \u00b0C for 25 min, while the lowest amounts were observed in those roasted at 135 \u00b0C for 80 min. Ellagitannins were the dominant class of phenolic compounds in the raw samples, while EA derivatives were more abundant in heat-treated seeds. Interestingly, the second most abundant phenolic group in both unroasted and roasted samples were phenolic glycosides. The predominant individual phenolic compounds, in raw seeds, were cretanin, oenothein B and rugosin E isomers. Since, among the phenolics found in the raw seeds, cretanin had the highest thermal stability, while dimeric ellagitannins and high molecular weight gallotannins exhibited the least thermal stability. The roasted samples contained mainly compounds formed by further decomposition of abovementioned compounds. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

            "text": "Quality control of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) should be linked with the authentication and efficacy of TCM. Selaginella tamariscina is a frequently used traditional Chinese herbal medicine. However, its quality control is still difficult due to its multiple adulterants. We established quality markers (Q-markers) of S. tamariscina by using metabolomics, molecular networking and network pharmacology to improve the authenticity study and quality control of S. tamariscina. In this study, ultra high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrum (UHPLC-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analyses was applied to distinguish between S. tamariscina samples and their confusing adulterants. Principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were employed to screen the distinguishing markers from S. tamariscina samples and their adulterants. The top-2 distinguishing markers were isolated from S. tamariscina and identified by molecular networking together with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Network pharmacology predicted the bioactivity and cytotoxicity of the top-2 distinguishing markers. The top-2 distinguishing markers were adopted as Q-markers of S. tamariscina for content determination. Based on the results of ultra performance liquid chromatography-quardrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) metabolomics, we revealed that selaginellins could only be detected in S. tamariscina samples and contributed greatly to discriminating S. tamariscina samples from their confused species. The top-2 distinguishing markers were isolated and purified from S. tamariscina extract. Then, they were further identified as selaginellin and selaginellin A by molecular networking and NMR. Network pharmacology predicted the antitumor activity of selaginellin and selaginellin A, while the cytotoxicity assay verified their bioactivity. In conclusion, selaginellin and selaginellin A were selected as Q-markers for the determination and quality evaluation of S. tamariscina based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QQQ-MS). The ranges of the concentrations of selaginellin and selaginellin A were 41.57\u201344.89 \u03bcg/g and 15.09\u201316.75 \u03bcg/g, respectively. This study provides a novel strategy combining Ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry based (UHPLC-MS-based) metabolomics with molecular networking for rapid species identification of S. tamariscina and discovery of the Q-markers of TCM. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)"

In high latitude countries such as Norway, greenhouse vegetable production requires large amounts of energy for heat and light, especially during the winter. The use of renewable energy such as hydroelectricity and its effect on the environment has not been well documented. Neither has the effect of different production strategies on the environment been studied to a large extent. We conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) of greenhouse tomato production for mid-March to mid-October (seasonal production), 20th January to 20th November (extended seasonal) production, and year-round production including the processes from raw material extraction to farm gate. Three production seasons and six greenhouse designs were included, at one location in southwestern and one in northern Norway. The SimaPro software was used to calculate the environmental impact. Across the three production seasons, the lowest global warming (GW) potential (600 g CO2-eq per 1 kg tomatoes) was observed during year-round production in southwestern Norway for the design NDSFMLLED + LED, while the highest GW potential (3100 g CO2-eq per 1 kg tomatoes) was observed during seasonal production in northern Norway for the design NS. The choice of artificial lighting (HPS (High Pressure Sodium) or LED (Light Emitting Diodes)), heating system and the production season was found to have had a considerable effect on the environmental impact. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in most of the impact categories including GW potential, terrestrial acidification, and fossil resource scarcity from seasonal to year-round production. Overall, year-round production in southwestern Norway had the lowest environmental impact of the evaluated production types. Heating of the greenhouse using natural gas and electricity was the biggest contributor to most of the impact categories. The use of an electric heat pump and LED lights during extended seasonal and year-round production both decreased the environmental impact. However, while replacing natural gas with electricity resulted in decreased GW potential, it increased the ecotoxicity potential. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

The incorporation of red dragon fruit peel anthocyanin into cassava starch and chitosan films was used in this study as a color indicator to monitor food conditions. This indicator film was generated using the solvent-casting method. The mechanical, morphological, and physicochemical characterizations of the film were studied, and food freshness monitoring was carried out. The results showed that adding red dragon fruit peel anthocyanin increased up to 94.44% of the antioxidant activity. It also improved its flexibility, indicated by the lowest tensile strength (3.89 \u00b1 0.15 MPa) and Young\u2019s modulus (0.14 \u00b1 0.01 MPa) and the highest elongation at break (27.62 \u00b1 0.57%). The indicator film was sensitive to pH, which was indicated by its color change from red to yellow as pH increased. The color of the film also changed when it was used to test the freshness of packaged shrimp at both room and chiller temperatures. According to the results, the indicator film based on cassava starch\u2013chitosan incorporated with red dragon fruit peel anthocyanin showed its potential as a smart packaging material. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

However, producing commercial lines will likely require several plastome manipulations. This presents issues with respect to selectable markers, since there are a limited number available, they can be used only once in a serial engineering strategy, and it is undesirable to retain marker genes for antibiotic resistance in the final transplastome. To address these problems, we have designed a rapid iterative selection system, known as CpPosNeg, for the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that allows creation of marker-free transformants starting from wild-type strains. The system employs a dual marker\u00a0encoding a fusion protein of E. coli aminoglycoside adenyltransferase (AadA: conferring spectinomycin resistance) and a variant of E. coli cytosine deaminase (CodA: conferring sensitivity to 5-fluorocytosine). Initial selection on spectinomycin allows stable transformants to be established and driven to homoplasmy. Subsequent selection on 5-fluorocytosine results in rapid loss of the dual marker through intramolecular recombination between the 3\u2032UTR of the marker and the 3\u2032UTR of the introduced transgene. We demonstrate the versatility of the CpPosNeg system by serial introduction of reporter genes into the plastome. \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Biotechnology Journal published by Wiley-VCH GmbH."

The hook structure is transient but essential for seedlings' survival during soil emergence due to its efficient protection of the delicate shoot apex from mechanical injury. As a superb model system for studying plant differential growth, apical hook has fascinated botanists as early as the Darwin age, and significant advances have been achieved at both the morphological and molecular levels to understand how apical hook development is regulated. Here, we will mainly summarize the research progress at these two levels. We will also briefly compare the growth dynamics between apical hook and hypocotyl gravitropic bending at early seed germination phase, with the aim to deduce a certain consensus on their connections. Finally, we will outline the remaining questions and future research perspectives for apical hook development. \u00a9 2022 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

            "text": "Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer is a shade plant, and its leaves are an important medicinal part of P. ginseng. Light intensity plays a crucial role in physiological activities and metabolite accumulation in P. ginseng. Currently, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying physiological changes and quality under different light intensities in P. ginseng leaves. Therefore, we investigated the changes in photosynthetic physiology, secondary metabolism, transcriptomics, and metabolomics of P. ginseng leaves under different light intensities [T20 (20\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0m-2\u00b7s-1), T50 (50\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0m-2\u00b7s\u22121), T100 (100\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121)]]. Higher light intensity positively influenced the yield, photosynthesis, and accumulation of polysaccharides, soluble sugars, terpenoids, and ginsenosides in P. ginseng leaves. The T100 treatment notably promoted the accumulation of ginsenosides in the leaves, resulting in a 68.32% and 45.55% increase in total ginsenosides compared to the T20 and T50 treatments, respectively. Ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, Rg2, Rb2, Rb3, and Rd were 1.28-, 1.47-, 2.32-, 1.64-, 1.28-, 2.59-, 1.66-, and 2.28-times higher than in the T20 treatment. Furthermore, 285 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) and 4218 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the metabolome and transcriptome of P. ginseng leaves, respectively, were identified. 13 triterpenoid saponins were significantly upregulated, and three were downregulated. The expression of genes encoding photosystem II reaction center proteins was upregulated under the T100 treatment, thereby increasing photosynthetic activity. The T100 treatment enhanced the expression of genes involved in photosynthetic carbon and energy metabolism in P. ginseng. The expression of antenna protein synthesis genes was upregulated under the T20, which increased the ability to capture light in P. ginseng leaves. T100 upregulated the expression of HMGR, SS, CYP716A53v2, UGT74AE, PgUGT1, and UGTPg45, thereby promoting terpene and ginsenoside synthesis. In summary, 100\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121 was conducive to quality formation of P. ginseng leaves. This study elucidates molecular mechanisms underlying the photosynthetic physiology and ginsenoside synthesis in P. ginseng under varying light intensities and provides a theoretical basis for the P. ginseng cultivation and its industrial production of secondary metabolites.

In this study, we analyzed the photosynthetic and water use characteristics of two deciduous broad-leaved (Sorbus matsumurana and Betula ermanii) and two evergreen coniferous (Abies mariesii and Pinus pumila) tree species at the treeline\u2013i.e. the line connecting the highest patches of forest composed of trees at least three meters high\u2013of Mt. Norikura in central Japan, to explore the physiological adaptations of trees to alpine environments. We monitored diurnal changes in leaf gas exchange rates and leaf and soil water potentials in each tree species during the growing season, as well as bulk leaf water relations based on pressure\u2013volume curves and whole-tree hydraulic structures. The four species under study relied on different physiological characteristics at both leaf and plant levels for adaptation to their natural habitat. For maintaining water in leaves, S. matsumurana showed higher water use efficiency (WUE; the ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration) and osmotic adjustment. In contrast, B. ermanii showed lower WUE, while maintaining higher soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductivity with less stomatal control. In turn, A. mariesii showed higher WUE and leaf succulence. Meanwhile, P. pumila showed lower WUE but compensated for water loss through higher leaf hydraulic capacitance and tissue elasticity. Our observations demonstrate that tree species rely on specific physiological characteristics to adapt to the alpine treeline environment. \u00a9 2023 The Japanese Forest Society."

Existing technology does not allow the simultaneous investigation of spatial interactions between a host and the multitude of its colonizing microorganisms, which limits our understanding of host\u2013microorganism interactions within a plant or animal tissue. Here we present spatial metatranscriptomics (SmT), a sequencing-based approach that leverages 16S/18S/ITS/poly-d(T) multimodal arrays for simultaneous host transcriptome- and microbiome-wide characterization of tissues at 55-\u00b5m resolution. We showcase SmT in outdoor-grown Arabidopsis thaliana leaves as a model system, and find tissue-scale bacterial and fungal hotspots. By network analysis, we study inter- and intrakingdom spatial interactions among microorganisms, as well as the host response to microbial hotspots. SmT provides an approach for answering fundamental questions on host\u2013microbiome interplay. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s)."

The two bean varieties were subjected to a 10% PEG simulated drought stress treatment, and the resultant physiological and biochemical characteristics of the leaves and roots were compared. The superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and other indicators were higher in \u2018HZYTJ\u2019 than in \u2018WZWJD\u2019; additionally, the \u2018HZYTJ\u2019 exhibited slower changes in response to stress. The proline content in \u2018HZYTJ\u2019 changed slowly compared to that in \u2018WZWJD\u2019. The transcriptome analysis of the two varieties showed that 1,361 and 1,447 genes were differentially expressed in \u2018HZYTJ\u2019 and \u2018WZWJD\u2019, respectively. DEGs were also analyzed via the KEGG pathway database, and 10 significant metabolic pathways were found to be involved in \u2018HZYTJ\u2019, while nine were found in \u2018WZWJD\u2019. Using the GO function database, we found that 111 significant GO terms were involved in \u2018HZYTJ\u2019, whereas 125 were involved in \u2018WZWJD\u2019. Through analysis of transcription factors, 487 DEGs were identified, of which bHLH transcription factors were the most abundant, followed by ERF, MYB-related, B3 and other transcription factor families. The selected and screened genes with DEGs were validated by qRT\u2013PCR. These results provide a basis for further research into the drought resistance of the common bean. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

This study uses a radiotracer (14C-PFOA) to study the uptake and translocation of PFOA in hydroponically grown brown mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.], a representative crop species. Plants were exposed in quadruplicate over the course of 7 d (with plants sampled on Days 4 and 7) to PFOA concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15\u00a0mg L\u22121. Uptake was quantified via liquid scintillation counting of samples from the nutrient solution, roots, stems, and leaves. Transfer factors (roots to shoots) ranged from 0.15 to 4.73\u00a0kg kg\u22121. Bioconcentration factors (solution to plant) ranged from 0.36 to 62.29 L kg\u22121. Factors were influenced by plant compartment, day sampled, and treatment level. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

            "text": "Background: Invasive species can threaten native diversity and alter ecosystem processes while interacting with other components of global environmental change. Invasive plants are becoming increasingly problematic and this can be stimulated by changes in the environment. However, existing studies have primarily investigated the effects of environmental change on a specific stage of plant invasion rather than the continuous invasion process. Methods: A space-for-time substitution experiment was performed to investigate how warming and nitrogen deposition affects the invasion process of a plant. Specifically, different ratios of invasive Solidago canadensis L. to native Artemisia argyi Levl. et Van were employed as a proxy to represent successive levels of invasion. A total of seven treatments were applied in the experiment: ambient (CK), N addition (+ 5, + 12\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0year\u22121), warming (+ 1.15, + 1.86\u00a0\u00b0C) and their interaction (5\u00a0g\u00a0N\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0year\u22121 + 1.15\u00a0\u00b0C, 12\u00a0g\u00a0N\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0year\u22121 + 1.86\u00a0\u00b0C). The growth performance and competitiveness of S. canadensis were investigated. Results: The competitiveness of Solidago canadensis decreased linearly with its invasion degree (p < 0.05). Non-linear regression showed that S. canadensis invasion levels of 53%, 53%, 68%, 55% and 58% were the critical thresholds for shifting the direction or magnitude of chlorophyll, leaf nitrogen, leaf shape index, diameter, and root/shoot ratio, respectively. Compared with the ambient treatment (CK, no warming and no N addition), the diameter, height, biomass and relative competitiveness of S. canadensis were each limited by warming, to a certain extent, whereas these and the above parameters were significantly increased by nitrogen deposition. The interaction of increased temperature and nitrogen deposition led to significant increases in the growth and competitiveness of S. canadensis, and this effect was detected in every stage of the invasion, throughout the invasion process. Conclusions: Environmental change might have a continuous, progressive, and augmentative effect on the phenotypic traits of S. canadensis. This study provides fairly robust evidence that environmental change promotes the invasion process of S. canadensis in general, not simply in specific stages. In the future, rather than focusing on specific stages, experimental studies should consider examining invasion on a broader scale. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

            "text": "Background: The carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is one of the most iconic tree species of the Mediterranean region, with valuable economic, ecological and cultural value. Carob has been exploited around the Mediterranean region since antiquity and has been regarded as an important component of natural habitats and traditional agroecosystems. Several studies have focused on its morphological, biochemical, and genetic diversity. However, less is known about the intraspecific variation of seed traits. In this regard, and as an overall objective, we intend to evaluate the amplitude and the expression of intraspecific variations of carob seed traits at different ecological scales ranging from individual trees to different geographical landscapes. In addition, we investigated how the climate along the study area affects the extent of carob seed variability. Using image analysis techniques, we measured seven traits related to the size and the shape of 1740 seeds collected from 18 populations of spontaneous C. siliqua distributed along a latitudinal transect in Morocco under different bioclimatic conditions. Results: The morphometric analysis of carob seed showed the effectiveness of adopted approach to highlight the amount and the amplitude of intraspecific variation according to geographic and climatic factors. Seed trait analysis revealed high intraspecific variability, explained by differences between and among carob populations and geographic zones. Seed area, perimeter, length, and width showed the largest variability between geographic zones. However, circularity, aspect ratio, and seed roundness showed higher variability at the tree level. Finally, our results show that seed traits vary depending on altitude and climate condition. Conclusions: Revealing the amount and the structure of intraspecific traits variability of carob seed provides interesting insights to understand the mechanisms underlying trees adaptation to various environmental and ecological conditions. Therefore, intraspecific variation of seed traits should be integrated into trait-based functional ecology to assess plant species responses to environmental changes. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

A plethora of organic molecules were encapsulated within the cavities of supramolecular hosts, and the impact of the cavity size and polarity was widely investigated. However, the extent to which the properties of the confined guests can be affected by the symmetry of the cagewhich dictates the shape of the cavityremains to be understood. Here we show that cage symmetry has a dramatic effect on the equilibrium between two isomers of the encapsulated spiropyran guests. Working with two Pd-based coordination cages featuring similarly sized but differently shaped hydrophobic cavities, we found a highly selective stabilization of the isomer whose shape matches that of the cavity of the cage. A Td-symmetric cage stabilized the spiropyrans' colorless form and rendered them photochemically inert. In contrast, a D2h-symmetric cage favored the colored isomer, while maintaining reversible photoswitching between the two states of the encapsulated spiropyrans. We also show that the switching kinetics strongly depend on the substitution pattern on the spiropyran scaffold.

Subsequently, large datasets have pioneered the data-driven approach, an alternative to the traditional hypothesis-testing system, for researchers. However, processing, interpreting, and elucidating enormous datasets is no longer possible without computation. Bioinformatics is a field that has developed over long periods, intending to understand biological phenomena using methods collected from information science and statistics, thus solving this proposed research challenge. This review presents the latest methodologies and applications in sequencing, imaging, and mass spectrometry that were developed using bioinformatics. We presented the features of individual techniques and outlines in each part, avoiding the use of complex algorithms and formulas to allow beginning researchers to understand an overview. In the section on sequencing, we focused on comparative genomic, transcriptomic, and bacterial microbiome analyses, which are frequently used as applications of next-generation sequencing. Bioinformatic methods for handling sequence data and case studies were described. In the section on imaging, we introduced the analytical methods and microscopy imaging informatics techniques used in animal cell biology and plant physiology. We introduce informatics technologies for maximizing the value of measured data, including predicting the structure of unknown molecules and untargeted analysis in the section on mass spectrometry. Finally, we discuss the future outlook of this field. We anticipate that this review will assist biologists in using bioinformatics more effectively. \u00a9 2022 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan"

The foamed sauce was dried in a batch-type thin-layer dryer at constant conditions (temperature of 60 \u00b0C). Six thin-layer drying models were employed to determine the drying kinetics of the pasta sauce. The results showed that an increase in the egg white concentration and a decrease in the whipping time produced a foamed sauce with low foam density and viscosity and high foam expansion.

They display versatile features due to the combination of both their stable Si-O-Si inorganic cores and the large number of possible organic groups that can be attached to them. The present work aims at characterizing a highly-thermoresistant POSS, the octa(aminophenyl)silsesquioxane (OAPS). This siloxane-based cage has three different isomers depending on the meta, ortho and para positions of the amines with respect to the phenyl groups and can be obtained using two synthesis routes. However, the presence of the isomers depends on the synthesis route and remains up to now an open question. Experimental characterizations including pycnometry, infrared spectroscopy (IR), 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have been performed for a commercial OAPS containing all three isomers and a controlled OAPS containing only the para and meta isomers. The density is found to be insensitive to the nature of the isomers, unlike the IR, 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectra that are isomer-dependent. To better identify the isomers, the experimental IR and NMR spectra were compared to predictions from Density Functional Theory (DFT) quantum mechanical methods and by machine-learning analyses. Within this context, quantum mechanical methods were found to be clearly superior to machine-learning methods, despite being computationally much more expensive. As a result, several peaks in the IR spectra and each peak in both the 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectra could be assigned to a specific OAPS isomer. \u00a9 2022"

The goal of this study is to determine the physicochemical properties of rice dried using a 915 MHz microwave and then aged. Two rice cultivars, a medium grain cultivar Titan and long grain hybrid cultivar XL753, with a harvest moisture content of 20% \u00b1 1% (wet basis) were used for the study. The rice samples were treated with two different drying methods, natural air drying as control and microwave heating at 915 MHz frequency followed by tempering and natural air cooling at 25\u00b0C and 56% relative humidity (RH). Microwave-dried samples were treated at specific energies ranging from 360 to 630 kJ/kg of initial wet grain mass (kJ/kg-grain). Head rice samples were stored for 6 months at 4\u00b0C\u00a0and 25\u00b0C representing nonaged and aged samples, respectively. Physicochemical properties of the samples were determined. Findings: Aged microwave-dried rice had significantly higher setback viscosity, cooked rice hardness and gumminess, and significantly lower peak viscosity and solid loss than nonaged rice. The changes in the viscosity profiles of aged microwave-dried rice were generally similar to the trends recorded for aged control rice. Furthermore, aging significantly increased the water uptake and kernel elongation ratio of microwave-dried rice cultivar XL753 but had no significant impact on rice cultivar Titan. Statistical models indicate that the solid loss of microwave-dried rice decreases by 0.083% while the final viscosity, kernel elongation ratio, and hardness increase by 30 cP, 0.014, and 41 g respectively, with every degree Celsius increase in aging temperature (between 4\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C), when all other variables are kept constant. Also, aged microwave-dried rice that were treated at 360 and 525 kJ/kg-grain were practically equivalent in terms of hardness and solid loss. Conclusions: Natural aging of microwave-dried rice (dried at 915 MHz frequency) led to changes in some physicochemical properties which were generally similar to the aging patterns of the control rice. Microwave specific energy of 525 kJ/kg-grain is recommended for rice drying because it produces rice with desirable drying and aging properties. Significance and Novelty: This study provides processing recommendations that can be used to select microwave parameters for rice drying, which will achieve desirable rice properties. \u00a9 2022 Cereals & Grains Association."

Regulatory feedback mechanisms are at the basis of these networks. Here, we report that plants improve their heat stress tolerance through HSF-mediated transcriptional regulation of MIR169 and post-transcriptional regulation of Nuclear Factor-YA (NF-YA) transcription factors. We show that HSFs recognize tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis MIR169 promoters using yeast one-hybrid/chromatin immunoprecipitation\u2013quantitative PCR. Silencing tomato HSFs using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) reduced Sly-MIR169 levels and enhanced Sly-NF-YA9/A10 target expression. Further, Sly-NF-YA9/A10 VIGS knockdown tomato plants and Arabidopsis plants overexpressing At-MIR169d or At-nf-ya2 mutants showed a link with increased heat tolerance. In contrast, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing At-NF-YA2 and those expressing a non-cleavable At-NF-YA2 form (miR169d-resistant At-NF-YA2) as well as plants in which At-miR169d regulation is inhibited (miR169d mimic plants) were more sensitive to heat stress, highlighting NF-YA as a negative regulator of heat tolerance. Furthermore, post-transcriptional cleavage of NF-YA by elevated miR169 levels resulted in alleviation of the repression of the heat stress effector HSFA7 in tomato and Arabidopsis, revealing a retroactive control of HSFs by the miR169:NF-YA node. Hence, a regulatory feedback loop involving HSFs, miR169s and NF-YAs plays a critical role in the regulation of the heat stress response in tomato and Arabidopsis plants. \u00a9 2022 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

            "text": "The pneumatic method is a novel method determining vulnerability to embolism in plants, yet it remains unclear whether this method is suitable for all species with different xylem anatomy. In this study, using six tree species with contrasting xylem anatomy, including four vessel-bearing species (diffuse-porous wood and ring-porous wood) and two tracheid-bearing species (non-porous wood), we test the reliability of the pneumatic method by comparing to hydraulic methods and also considering turgor loss point and native embolism. Vessel length distribution and cut-open vessel volume were also evaluated using the silicone injection technique. Additionally, we also synthesized published data to find out the consistency between the pneumatic method and hydraulic methods. Results showed that there was a maximum 10-folds difference in mean vessel length and mean vessel diameter varying from 30 to 56 \u03bcm among species. The estimated open vessel volume ranges from 0.064 to 0.397 mL, with a maximum of 14% of the tube vacuum reservoir. For four vessel-bearing species, the pneumatic method showed good consistency with hydraulic methods, and this consistency was evidenced by turgor loss point and native embolism. For two tracheid-bearing species, the pneumatic method significantly overestimated vulnerability because of the bad consistencies with hydraulic methods and plant water relations. Data synthesis of 56 species also suggested that the pneumatic method can accurately measure the embolism vulnerability of vessel-bearing species but not for tracheid-bearing species. Our study provided further evidence that the pneumatic method is accurate for most vessel-bearing species and thus has the potential to be widely used in the plant hydraulics field. However, we proposed that the precise calculation of air discharge volume should take into account the volume of open vessels for species with wide and long vessels. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Such conditions occurred in Finland in June and July 2021, offering a good opportunity to study the field performance of seedlings and which factors, including the weather, regeneration site, and operational or seedling level factors, affected the field performance of the seedlings. In the survey, 65 regeneration sites planted with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) container seedlings from May to July 2021 were randomly selected from different parts of South and Central Finland (60\u201364\u00b0N), and several variables were assessed in sample plots from these sites in September\u2013October 2021. On average, 6 % of the seedlings died, and 26 % were damaged during the first growing season. In most cases, the damage was caused by drought. The most important factors affecting drought risk were the planting period and packaging and storage methods of the seedlings: in freezer-stored seedlings, the probability of drought damage was <0.20 for all planting periods, except for July; when the seedlings overwintered outdoors and were delivered to the forest in open trays, the risk of damage was <0.25 when they had been planted in May and early June, but in late June, it was > 0.60. When the seedlings had overwintered outdoors and were then packed in closed packaging, the risk was >0.20, regardless of the planting period. A low previous-year height of the seedlings (especially in the outdoor stored seedlings), precipitation a week before planting, and a low average temperature two weeks after planting reduced the risk of drought damage. When the average air temperature was below 15 \u00b0C (i.e., during the May plantings), the shade of the nearby stand slightly reduced the drought risk, but in higher temperatures, shade did not affect it. The effect of the pre-planting precipitation was stronger in coarse-textured and peat soils than in medium-coarse soils. The risk of drought damage was lowest when the freezer-stored seedlings were planted in good quality mineral soil mounds, deep enough in medium-rich (MT type) and medium-coarse soils. It is impossible to completely prevent drought damage in newly planted Norway spruce seedlings, but by optimizing operational choices and measures, the development of full density fast-growing young Norway spruce forests can also be ensured in a warming climate. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)"

            "text": "Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in plant gene regulation, involving both epigenetic and transcript regulation. LncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into functional proteins but can be translated into small peptides. Machine learning models have predominantly used transcriptome data with manually defined features to detect lncRNAs, however, they often underrepresent the abundance of lncRNAs and can be biased in their detection. Here we present a study using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to identify plant lncRNAs from genomic sequences rather than transcriptomic data. The NLP models were trained to predict lncRNAs for seven model and crop species (Zea mays, Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Glycine max and Oryza sativa) using publicly available genomic references. We demonstrated that lncRNAs can be accurately predicted from genomic sequences with the highest accuracy of 83.4% for Z. mays and the lowest accuracy of 57.9% for B. rapa, revealing that genome assembly quality might affect the accuracy of lncRNA identification. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential of using NLP models for cross-species prediction with an average of 63.1% accuracy using target species not previously seen by the model. As more species are incorporated into the training datasets, we expect the accuracy to increase, becoming a more reliable tool for uncovering novel lncRNAs. Finally, we show that the models can be interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence to identify motifs important to lncRNA prediction and that these motifs frequently flanked the lncRNA sequence. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

            "text": "The precise characterization of cellular differentiation potency remains an open question, which is fundamentally important for deciphering the dynamics mechanism related to cell fate transition. We quantitatively evaluated the differentiation potency of different stem cells based on the Hopfield neural network (HNN). The results emphasized that cellular differentiation potency can be approximated by Hopfield energy values. We then profiled the Waddington energy landscape of embryogenesis and cell reprogramming processes. The energy landscape at single-cell resolution further confirmed that cell fate decision is progressively specified in a continuous process. Moreover, the transition of cells from one steady state to another in embryogenesis and cell reprogramming processes was dynamically simulated on the energy ladder. These two processes can be metaphorized as the motion of descending and ascending ladders, respectively. We further deciphered the dynamics of the gene regulatory network (GRN) for driving cell fate transition. Our study proposes a new energy indicator to quantitatively characterize cellular differentiation potency without prior knowledge, facilitating the further exploration of the potential mechanism of cellular plasticity.; We are grateful to J.

            "text": "In nature, multiple stress factors occur simultaneously. The screening of natural diversity panels and subsequent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) is a powerful approach to identify genetic components of various stress responses. Here, the nutritional status variation of a set of 270 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana grown on a natural saline-carbonated soil is evaluated. We report significant natural variation on leaf Na (LNa) and Fe (LFe) concentrations in the studied accessions. Allelic variation in the NINJA and YUC8 genes is associated with LNa diversity, and variation in the ALA3 is associated with LFe diversity. The allelic variation detected in these three genes leads to changes in their mRNA expression and correlates with plant differential growth performance when plants are exposed to alkaline salinity treatment under hydroponic conditions. We propose that YUC8 and NINJA expression patters regulate auxin and jasmonic signaling pathways affecting plant tolerance to alkaline salinity. Finally, we describe an impairment in growth and leaf Fe acquisition associated with differences in root expression of ALA3, encoding a phospholipid translocase active in plasma membrane and the trans Golgi network which directly interacts with proteins essential for the trafficking of PIN auxin transporters, reinforcing the role of phytohormonal processes in regulating ion homeostasis under alkaline salinity. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

HPLC-TLC standardized white tea fraction (WT-F) rendered higher extractive-yield (21%, w/w), than green tea fraction(GT-F) (12%, w/w). WT-F containing flavonoids and non-hydrolysable polyphenols showed better antioxidant activity, rather than equivalent GT-F. WT-F demonstrated remarkable anti-rheumatoid-arthritis activity via killing of synovial fibroblast cells (66.1%), downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 (93.33%), IL-6 (87.97%), and p-STAT3 inhibition (77.75%). Furthermore, WT-F demonstrated better anti-proliferative activity against colon cancer cells (HCT-116). Collectively, our study revealed that the white tea fraction has boundless potential as anti-rheumatoid arthritis and anti-proliferative agent coupled with apoptotic, antioxidant anti-proteinase, and anti-inflammatory properties. Practical applications: Our eco-friendly extracted bioactive aqueous fraction of white tea, characterized by TLC-HPLC study and phytochemical screening have demonstrated remarkable anti-rheumatoid arthritis property and anti-proliferative action on colon cancer cells including potential anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proteinase efficacy. The test WT-F sample has shown impressive safety on normal mammalian cells. WT-F has demonstrated better efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis and cancer model compared to equivalent green tea fraction. Traditionally, it is extensively used for boosting immunity, and energy, with cosmetic, and agricultural applications by the native inhabitants. So, the aqueous fraction of WT is suggested to be used as a prophylactic nutraceutical supplement and or therapeutic agent in commercial polyherbal formulation to attenuate and management of auto-inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis and carcinogenesis of colon. It is additionally suggested to establish in vivo rheumatoid arthritis animal and clinical study to validate their pharmacokinetic stability and dose optimization coupled with anti-inflammatory, cytotoxicity, and anti-oxidant property. \u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Better tuning of their activity in a time and dose-dependent manner should allow precise control of gene expression. Here, we report the optimization of a Copper Inducible system called CI-switch for conditional gene activation in Nicotiana benthamiana. In the presence of copper, the copper-responsive factor CUP2 undergoes a conformational change and binds a DNA motif named copper-binding site (CBS). Results: In this study, we tested several activation domains fused to CUP2 and found that the non-viral Gal4 domain results in strong activation of a reporter gene equipped with a minimal promoter, offering advantages over previous designs. To connect copper regulation with downstream programmable elements, several copper-dependent configurations of the strong dCasEV2.1 PTA were assayed, aiming at maximizing activation range, while minimizing undesired background expression. The best configuration involved a dual copper regulation of the two protein components of the PTA, namely dCas9:EDLL and MS2:VPR, and a constitutive RNA pol III-driven expression of the third component, a guide RNA with anchoring sites for the MS2 RNA-binding domain. With these optimizations, the CI/dCasEV2.1 system resulted in copper-dependent activation rates of 2,600-fold and 245-fold for the endogenous N. benthamiana DFR and PAL2 genes, respectively, with negligible expression in the absence of the trigger. Conclusions: The tight regulation of copper over CI/dCasEV2.1 makes this system ideal for the conditional production of plant-derived metabolites and recombinant proteins in the field. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

Polymer fluorescence was confirmed by determination of quantum yield by comparative method with piroxicam as the standard exhibiting dependency of emission intensity on the polymer chain hydrophilicity and the kind of solvent. The RhB functionalized polymers were used for biological tests in plant materials except for RhB-PHEMATMS because of weak fluorescence. These two polymers slightly differed in cellular localization. RhB-PChMA was mostly observed in cell walls of root tissues and cotyledon epidermis. It was also observed in cytoplasm and cell organelles of root cap cells and rhizodermis, in contrast with cytoplasm of cotyledon epidermis. RhB-PHEMA was also present in apoplast. A strong signal in protoxylem cell walls and a weak signal in cell walls of rhizodermis and cortex were visible. Moreover, it was also present in cell walls of cotyledon epidermis. However, RhB-PHEMA was mostly observed in cytoplasm and cell organelles of all root tissues and epidermis of cotyledons. Both RhB-polymers did not cause cell death which means that they can be used in living plant material. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

The application of NMs and nanotechnology\u00a0in agrochemicals dramatically overcomes the defects of conventional agrochemicals, including low bioavailability, easy photolysis, and organic solvent pollution, etc. In this review, we describe advances in the application of NMs in chemical pesticides and fertilizers, which are the two earliest and most researched areas of NMs in agrochemicals. Besides, this article concerns with the new applications of NMs in other agrochemicals, such as bio-pesticides, nucleic acid pesticides, plant growth regulators (PGRs), and pheromone. We also discuss challenges and the industrialization trend of NMs in the field of agrochemicals. Constructing nano-agrochemical delivery system via NMs and nanotechnology facilitates the improvement of the stability and dispersion of active ingredients, promotes the precise delivery of agrochemicals, reduces residual pollution and decreases labor cost in different application scenarios, which is potential to maintain the sustainability of agricultural systems and improve food security by increasing the efficacy of agricultural inputs.

However, owing to insufficient genetic diversity and to fundamental differences in immune mechanisms, small-animal models of human diseases are often unsuitable for immunogenicity testing and for predicting adverse outcomes in human patients. Most human therapeutic antibodies trigger xenogeneic responses in wild-type animals and thus rapid clearance of the drugs, which makes in vivo toxicological testing of human antibodies challenging. Here we report the generation of G\u00f6ttingen minipigs carrying a mini-repertoire of human genes for the immunoglobulin heavy chains \u03b31 and \u03b34 and the immunoglobulin light chain \u03ba. In line with observations in human patients, the genetically modified minipigs tolerated the clinically non-immunogenic IgG1\u03ba-isotype monoclonal antibodies daratumumab and bevacizumab, and elicited antibodies against the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab and the engineered interleukin cergutuzumab amunaleukin. The humanized minipigs can facilitate the safety and efficacy testing of therapeutic antibodies. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

In this study, structural information of individual species within Virent's Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK) is identified by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy. By mass, 71.3% of the components elute within six peaks of the chromatogram, from which 12 unique species are identified through a novel deconvolution method. Overall, the identification of 93.6%m across 26 structural isomers is made by the methods described in this work. With 93.6%m ascribed to specific isomers, the precision of fuel property predictions improves dramatically. For example, the absolute error of the viscosity prediction is reduced by 90% because of this advancement in diagnostic capability, and its 95-percentile confidence interval (precision only) is reduced by 93%. Additionally, the properties of SAK, blended with hydro processed esters fatty acids (HEFA), are demonstrated to have blended properties consistent with conventional jet fuel. \u00a9 2022"

During water shortage, plants limit the formation of new stoma via the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) to conserve water. However, how ABA suppresses stomatal production is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that three core SnRK2 kinases of ABA signaling inhibit the initiation and proliferation of the stomatal precursors in Arabidopsis. We show that the SnRK2s function within the precursors and directly phosphorylate SPEECHLESS (SPCH), the master transcription factor for stomatal initiation. We identify specific SPCH residues targeted by the SnRK2s, which mediate the ABA/drought-induced suppression of SPCH and stomatal production. This SnRK2-specific SPCH phosphocode connects stomatal development with ABA/drought signals and enables the independent control of this key water conservation response. Our work also highlights how distinct signaling activities can be specifically encoded on a master regulator to modulate developmental plasticity. Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors,"

The system is capable of performing inferences on the health status of individual plants, and to determine their locations and shapes in a georeferenced orthomosaic. Accuracy achieved on the classification task was 94.5. AP values among classes were in the range of (Formula presented.) for plant location boxes, and in (Formula presented.) for foliar area predictions. The methodology requires only RGB images, and so, it can be replicated for the monitoring of other types of crops by only employing consumer-grade UAVs. A comparison with random forest and large-scale mean shift segmentation methods which use predetermined features is presented.

Their presence on the touristic beaches, however, is a problem for the tourism industry due to the lack of aesthetics and safety reasons. At the present time, seagrass leaves are landfilled, although this is not considered an ecological waste management practice. Among other proposed practices for more sustainable and environmentally friendly management, such as composting and biogas or energy generation, in this study we aim to use seagrass leaves for the production of insulation materials. Insulation boards from two types of seagrass leaves (Posidonia oceanica and Zostera marina) at densities varying from 80 to 200 kg m\u22123 were prepared and their physical and mechanical properties were examined and compared to those of wood fiber insulation boards. The thermal conductivity of seagrass-based insulation boards varied from 0.042 to 0.050 W m\u22121 K\u22121, which was up to 12% lower compared to the latter. The cone calorimetry analysis revealed that seagrass-based insulation boards are more fire resistant than those from wood fibers, as they release very low amounts of heat during combustion and do not ignite when exposed to a single flame (Bunsen burner). A simplified cost analysis showed that insulation boards made from seagrass leaves can be up to 30% cheaper compared to those made from wood fibers. After their end of life, seagrass leaves can again be considered a valuable resource and be further utilized by adopting other management strategies. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Rhizospheric soil pH (6.0), E.C (2.41 ds/m), field capacity, and moisture content level were estimated in the present study. We observed from the estimated results that the agronomic characteristics, i.e., shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight in T9 (4oC + 150 mM NaCl), root fresh weight and root dry weight in T4 (PEG + 100 mM NaCl), shoot moisture content in T5 (PEG + 100 mM NaCl), and root moisture content in T6 (PEG + 150 mM NaCl) were the highest, followed by the lowest in T1 (both shoot and root fresh weights) and T2 (shoot and root dry weights). Similarly, the shoot moisture content was the maximum in T5 and the minimum in T6, and root moisture was the highest in T6. We observed from the estimated results that agronomical parameters including dry masses (T4, T6, T4), leaf area index, germination index, leaf area, total biomass, seed vigor index under treatment T9, and relative water content and water use efficiency during T5 and T6 were the highest. Plant physiological traits such as proline, SOD enhanced by T1, carotenoids in treatment T2, and chlorophyll and protein levels were the highest under treatment T4, whereas sugar and POD were highest under treatments T7 and T8. The principal component analysis enclosed 63.75% of the total variation among all biological components. These estimated results confirmed the positive resistance by Vigna radiata during osmopriming (PEG) and thermopriming (4 \u00b0C) on most of the features with great tolerance under a low-saline treatment such as T4 (PEG), T5 (PEG + 100 mM NaCl), T7 (4 \u00b0C), and T8 (4 \u00b0C + 100 mM NaCl), while it was susceptible in the case of T6 (PEG + 150 mM NaCl) and T9 (4 \u00b0C + 150 mM NaCl) to high salt application. We found that the constraining impact of several priming techniques improved low salinity, which was regarded as economically inexpensive and initiated numerous metabolic processes in plants, hence decreasing germination time. The current study will have major applications for combatting the salinity problem induced by climate change in Pakistan. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Pollen and physicochemical analyses were performed taking into account the methodology of Louveaux et al. (1978) and AOAC (1990). A sensory analysis was also carried out by a group of semitrained panelists. The predominant color of the honeys evaluated was amber and light amber, associated with the pollen diversity of the native flora. Honeys from pollen of Schinopsis balansae and Copernicia alba presented high levels of mineral cations. Dark honeys presented higher intensity of the floral fresh fruity and woody aromas, whereas amber honeys presented higher intensity of the vegetal aroma. Honeys from pollen of Eugenia uniflora, Schinopsis balansae, Astronium balansae and Prosopis sp. presented fresh aroma with the licorice descriptor. \u00a9 2022"

Herein, morphological physiology, Cd accumulation and distribution, proteomic and metabolomic analyses were performed (using wheat cultivars \u2018Luomai23\u2032 (LM, Cd-sensitive) and \u2018Zhongyu10\u2032 (ZY, Cd-tolerant) at the seedling stage with sand culture) to reveal Cd tolerance mechanism. Cd inhibited wheat growth, caused oxidative stress, hindered carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and altered the quantity and composition of root exudates. The root Cd concentration was lower in ZY than in LM by about 35% under 15 \u03bcM Cd treatments. ZY reduced Cd uptake through root exudation of amino acids and alkaloids. ZY also reduced Cd accumulation through specific up-regulation (twice) of major facilitator superfamily (MFS) proteins. Furthermore, ZY enhanced Cd cell wall fixation and vacuolar compartmentalization by increasing pectin contents, hemicellulose1 contents, and adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1) transporter expression, thus reducing the Cd organelle fraction of ZY by about 12% and 44% in root and shoot, respectively, compared with LM. Additionally, ZY had enhanced resilience to Cd due to increased antioxidant capacity, plasma membrane stability, nitrogen metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, indicating that the increased Cd tolerance could be because of multi-level coordination. These findings provide a reference for exploring the molecular mechanism of Cd tolerance and accumulation, providing a basis for safe utilization of Cd-contaminated soil by breeding Cd-tolerant and low Cd-accumulating wheat varieties. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

The experimental design includes three different forms of shelter treatments (D1: experiment without any shelters; D2: experiment with closed shelters; D3: experiment with open shelters), each with three replicates. The results show that the concentration of the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and activities of phenoloxidase (PO), catalase (CAT), and acid phosphatase (ACP) in the D3 treatment are higher than those in the D1 treatment (all p < 0.05), with the highest concentrations of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and the highest activities of phenoloxidase (PO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), acid phosphatase (ACP), and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) among the treatments being present in the ovigerous P. clarkii in the D3 treatment. The hatching rates of the three treatments vary from 69.51% to 94.28%, with the highest rate found in the D3 treatment and the lowest in the D1 treatment, but there is no significant difference among them (p > 0.05). The highest incubation level (ind.\u00b7m\u22122) and the highest number of juveniles (ind.\u00b7m\u22122) among treatments are found in the D3 treatment, with the incubation level (ind.\u00b7m\u22122) in the D3 treatment being significantly higher than that in the D1 treatment (p < 0.05). The benefit\u2013cost ratios (BCRs) of the D2 and D3 treatments remain significantly higher than that of the D1 treatment when P. clarkii prices change (all p < 0.05). Our results indicate that a high stocking density habitat with open shelters could effectively improve the hatching and immune performance of ovigerous P. clarkii. Our findings are relevant for the indoor aquaculture management of ovigerous P. clarkii. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

            "text": "Wide and rapid Spartina alterniflora invasion has threatened the sustainability of coastal wetlands of China, and has a significant impact on sediment biogeochemical cycle. However, the effects of exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion on sediment dissimilatory nitrates (NOx\u2212) reduction processes and mechanisms underlying these pathways in mangrove wetlands have not been well studied. Here, denitrification (DEN), anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANA) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates, contributions (DEN%, ANA%, and DNRA%), associated functional genes (nirS, anammox 16S rRNA and nrfA) and controlling factors were investigated in surface sediments (0\u20135 cm) in mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities and ecotone of the Zhangjiang Estuary, China. Significant spatial differences in DEN, DNRA, DEN%, and DNRA% were found among different plant communities (p < 0.05 for all). DEN is the dominant pathway of NOx\u2212 reduction processes in Spartina alterniflora community (87\u201389 %) and ecotone (75\u201378 %), while DEN (41\u201351 %) and DNRA (36\u201351 %) compete with each other in mangrove community. Organic matter was the most dominating factor controlling DEN and DNRA rates. Without accounting for confounding factors, Spartina alterniflora invasion significantly reduced the nitrogen retention index (NIRI), causing a large amount of nitrogen (N) loss in wetlands. We estimated that Spartina alterniflora invasion has increased sediment N-loss (831.09 \u00b1 55.16 t N yr\u22121) but reduced N retention (783.48 \u00b1 37.73 t N yr\u22121) in mangrove habitats of China within last 40 years (1980\u20132020). Thus, Spartina alterniflora invasion enhances sediment N-loss while reducing N retention in mangrove wetlands, which may threaten the mangrove buffer function and wetland N pools protection in estuarine and coastal ecosystems. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)"

            "text": "The global production of cassava was estimated at ca. 303 million tons. Due to this high production, the cassava processing industry (cassava flour and starch) generates approximately ca. 0.65\u00a0kg of solid residue and ca. 25.3 l of wastewater per kg of fresh processed cassava root. The composition of the liquid effluent varies according to its origin; for example, the effluent from cassava flour production, when compared to the wastewater from the starch processing, presents a higher organic load (ca. 12 times) and total cyanide (ca. 29 times). It is worthy to highlight the toxicity of cassava residues regarding cyanide presence, which could generate disorders with acute or chronic symptoms in humans and animals. In this sense, the development of simple and low-cost eco-friendly methods for the proper treatment or reuse of cassava wastewater is a challenging, but promising path. Cassava wastewater is rich in macro-nutrients (proteins, starch, sugars) and micro-nutrients (iron, magnesium), enabling its use as a low-cost culture medium for biotechnological processes, such as the production of biosurfactants. These compounds are amphipathic molecules synthesized by living cells and can be widely used in industries as pharmaceutical agents, for microbial-enhanced oil recovery, among others. Amongst these biosurfactants, surfactin, rhamnolipids, and mannosileritritol lipids show remarkable properties such as antimicrobial, biodegradability, demulsifying and emulsifying capacity. However, the high production cost restricts the massive biosurfactant applications. Therefore, this study aims to present the state of the art and challenges in the production of biosurfactants using cassava wastewater as an alternative culture medium. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Both variables are sensitive to climate, and so evaluating thermal and photoperiodic effects on seedling development is fundamental, especially for climate change studies. Methods to quantify thermal time and the energy required for plants to reach a development stage include air temperature and cardinal temperatures. The photoperiod will also affect physiological reactions of a plant and thus its development. Here we evaluated the six thermal time methods widely used to compute thermal requirement, and identified the influence of the photoperiod from the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons and 12 sowing dates in Itajub\u00e1, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, on seedling development of three native tropical forest species Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae), Citharexylum myrianthum Cham. (Verbenaceae), and Bixa orellana L. (Bixaceae). The method used to quantify thermal time influenced the analytical results of seedling development; the one that considered three cardinal temperatures and compared them with the mean air temperature (Method 5) performed better in computing thermal requirements. The influence of photoperiod on seedling development was inconclusive for the three species, but all three developed better in mild temperatures (between 13.3\u00a0\u00b0C and 26.9\u00a0\u00b0C) with a photoperiod shorter than 13\u00a0h. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

These changes are hypothesized to increase mineral weathering and soil acidification rates. We investigated whether acidification rates and solute leaching fluxes are variable between permafrost-affected soils with different active layer thicknesses. We compared the fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved N and the ion fluxes associated with solute leaching and plant uptake to calculate proton budgets in the soils that differed in slope positions (upper slope and lower slope) and soil texture (clayey and sandy soils) in NW Canada. We found the wide variation in DOC and nitrate-N fluxes, depending on slope positions and soil texture. The nitrate-N fluxes were higher at the lower slope position of the sandy soil, compared to the upper slope position. Compared to sandy soils, the DOC fluxes from the organic horizons were higher in the clayey soils on shallower permafrost table. Organic acids were major proton sources in the organic horizons at all sites, but acidity was also contributed by nitrate (sandy and clayey soils at lower slope position) and carbonic acid (clayey soil at upper slope position). The weathering by carbonic acid lead to accumulation of short-range-order minerals in the clayey soils, while incipient podzolization of the sandy soils included the weathering of illite to vermiculite and the dissolution of short-range-order minerals. The shallower active layer thickness at the lower slope position resulted in lower plant productivity and acidification rates. In the permafrost-affected soils, the active layer thickness, the DOC and nitrate-N fluxes, and their contribution to acidification are dependent on the local variation in slope position and soil texture, as well as climate change. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)"

In such context, this research aimed at the characterization of the foliar anatomical structure of two populations of D. insularis (glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible biotypes) collected in agricultural areas of Paran\u00e1, a Brazilian state. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Botany of the Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Paran\u00e1 \u2013 Unioeste, Brazil. The resistant biotypes of D. insularis differ from the susceptible ones in several structural parameters. Among them, the Mesophyll Thickness in the interveinal region was 7.3% thicker in the resistant biotype, which was also observed in the thickness of the keel, in the percentage of 11.3%, and in the thickness of cuticles in the adaxial surface (TCad), which was 53.8% thicker in the resistant biotype. In this way, we concluded that the resistant biotypes of D. insularis differ from the susceptible ones in several anatomical foliar characteristics, therefore, they present possible mechanisms of resistance to glyphosate. \u00a9 This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, as long as the original work is properly cited."

The DHP skeleton was assembled by heating the reactants and silica gel in a closed vessel. Aliphatic amines provided 1,4-isomers as the main or only DHP products, but the reactions of aromatic amines yielded a mixture of 1,4- and 1,2-isomers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the formation of a 1,2-DHP structure by the reaction of an amine with propiolic ester. Addition of 1 mass percent of H2SO4 to silica gel shifted the product distribution to 1,4-DHP as the main or the only isomer obtained. Experimental and theoretical analyses led to the identification of two key intermediates en route to DHPs and the explanation of the observed regioisomeric ratios. 1,2-DHPs show blue-cyan fluorescence in MeOH with the quantum yield \u03a6 = 0.10-0.22 relative to quinine sulfate \u03a6 = 0.58 and 1,4-DHPs show blue-violet fluorescence with \u03a6 = 0.09-0.81. \u00a9 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

Separation of these diastereomers was accomplished through silica gel flash chromatography. The interplay of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and micro-segregation between the polar hydantoin unit and nonpolar aliphatic chains within the molecule endows them with remarkable self-assembly capabilities, both in solution and in the solid state. These hydantoin derivatives spontaneously form rosette-shaped structures composed of six molecules. In the solid state, these compounds display hexagonal columnar liquid crystal phases, with hydrogen-bonded disks as their fundamental building blocks. Similarly, when exposed to apolar solvents such as cyclohexane or dodecane, they adopt a columnar arrangement, resulting in gel formation comprising nanoscale fibers that intricately interlace to form a network. Remarkably, the two isomers exhibit markedly different properties. The major isomer behaves as a glassy liquid crystalline material, while the minor one exhibits liquid crystalline behavior with a high propensity to crystallize. Our experimental findings, in combination with theoretical studies, underscore the fundamentally distinct supramolecular organizations present in these isomers, shedding light on their unique self-assembling properties. \u00a9 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

Currently available technologies for the remediation of water pollution are mainly physical and chemical remediation, and bioremediation is used in relatively few places. This paper presents the advantages and disadvantages of phytoremediation of wastewater and the current status of the application. The existing physical remediation methods, chemical remediation methods, and then bioremediation methods of in situ and ex situ remediation are described. Phytoremediation belongs to the in situ remediation method of bioremediation, which refers to the use of green plants and their inter-root microorganisms to work together to fix or decompose pollutants. Different classifications of plants play different roles in remediation, and different kinds of plants of the same classification are applied in different environments. Compared with traditional restoration methods, phytoremediation has the advantages of lower cost, additional effect on the surrounding air and soil removal, improved soil fertility after restoration, improved local landscape, a wide range of adaptation and economic benefits, etc. However, phytoremediation technology also has its shortcomings, we should invest more scientific research efforts in the research of phytoremediation technology in the future, and combine it with practice to strengthen the application of phytoremediation in wastewater treatment and reduce the harm brought to people by polluted water resources. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

Sugar palm fiber (SPF) was cast into a biocomposite with cassava starch (CS) as the matrix and fructose as the plasticizer using the casting process. The thermoplastic CS composite sheet was loaded with different amounts of SPF (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% dry starch). The addition of SPF considerably improved the physical and thermal properties. It enhanced the thickness of the material while lowering its density, water content, and biodegradability. However, there was no significant increase in the tensile properties of the composite films. The filler had been absorbed into the matrix, according to SEM micrographs. With a higher concentration of SPF, the SPF/CS films had a more heterogeneous surface. It is indeed possible that the addition of SPF changed the film characteristics of cassava starch, potentially compromising the performance of the films. Overall, the findings of this study concentrate on enlightening about biopolymer composite film and highlighting its great potential for the food packaging market. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

One of the eco-friendly reuses of SCGs is their application as a natural fertilizer. This study adopted a soilless cultivation approach to growing Cucumis sativus seedlings using, as rooting media, different coffee solutions obtained by infusing fresh coffee powder or SCGs from mocha and pods for 7 or 30 days. Seedlings\u2019 germination, eco-physiological and biochemical traits were evaluated and the potential toxicological risks or beneficial effects of SCGs on plants were assessed. Results indicate that, although germination was unaffected, fresh coffee medium inhibited seedling development and that 7 days mocha solution stopped seedling growth and induced leaf structural alterations. Conversely, 30 days mocha and pod suspensions promoted seedling biomass, and increased leaf area, leaf polyphenol concentration, and photochemical efficiency. In conclusion, findings indicate that fresh powder can induce toxic effects while SCGs can improve cucumber from a physiological point of view by acting as a natural fertilizer. This study opens future investigations that will help manage coffee waste released into the environment by sustainable practices.

            "text": "In the process of continuous urbanization, planning errors sometimes appear. Urban structures are loosened, and places are created that do not have a clearly defined function. Empty spaces between two elements have several definitions and terms. One of them is vacant lot. Vacant lot, if they are not built up in a short period of time, they become \u201clost places\u201d that are out of control and out of order and consequently create green chaos in the city. This brings a new diversity to the urban structure and the possibility of recreation near residential buildings. Vacant lots have become part of the city for many decades and many undeveloped plots of land create an oasis of greenery within the urban environment. People have started to visit such places spontaneously and use them for daily recreation. Often it is no longer possible to bring them back into the city system because people have become accustomed to the greenery in their surroundings and do not always want to exchange it for a new building or a parking lot. A gap full of greenery provides a lot of freedom for visitors to recreate, unlike a city park which is strictly regulated. In such places, animals and plants are beginning to appear in addition to people. Many plants and animals have a presence and a safe territory in the space until the gap is of interest to urban planners or developers. At that point, the chaos becomes an asset and conservation becomes a priority for its visitors. In city centres, there is an emergence of recreational potential that needs to be explored and redesigned through low-cost interventions in the urban environment. This reduces the costs of maintenance, and transport for recreation. \u00a9 2023 Public Recreation and Landscape Protection - With Environment Hand in Hand? Proceedings of the 14th Conference.

In this work, essential oils (EOs) of M. pteleifolia (collected in 2021 and 2022) over different extraction time (1\u00a0h, 2\u00a0h, 5\u00a0h) were investigated for their chemical composition and insecticidal activities. The EOs extracted from fresh leaves in 2021 were named A1h, A2h and A5h, and extracted from fresh leaves in 2022 were named B1h, B2h and B5h. The chemical components of EOs were analyzed by GC-MS. \u03b1-Thujene is the common primary compound of the EOs A1h, A2h and A5h, which contained 83.27%, 63.86% and 25.17%, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that sesquiterpenes were the primary representative components in EOs. The EOs that were extracted for 5\u00a0h were significantly different from other EOs. Moreover, the EOs and \u03b1-thujene showed obvious contact and repellent activities against Lasioderma serricorne and Liposcelis bostrychophila. The gray correlation degree explained that EOs A2h and A5h had the strongest repellency against L. serricorne, while EOs A1h and B1h had the most significant repellent effect on L. bostrychophila, with coefficients above 0.50. The comprehensive score of weighting coefficient revealed that the scores of EOs A1h and A5h were the highest and both reached 0.80. In general, M. pteleifolia have the potential to be exploited as biological insecticide. \u00a9 2023, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. \u00a9 2023 Bo-Ya Li, Qiao-Hui Xie, Yu Zheng, Jia-Wei Zhang, Shuang Xu, Wang Dan and Du Shu-Shan."

            "text": "Research background. Curcuma species (Zingiberaceae) are well known medicinal herbs in India and Southeast Asia. Despite various findings reporting their beneficial biological activities, very little information has been recorded on the Curcuma caesia. Thus, this study aims to determine the phenolic content, antiox-idant and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity of both rhizome and leaves of C. caesia. Experimental approach. Rhizome and leaves of C. caesia were dried with oven (OD) and freeze (FD)-drying methods, and extracted with different \u03a6(etha-nol,water)=100:0, 80:20, 50:50 and 0:100. The bioactivities of C. caesia extracts were evaluated using in vitro tests; total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant (DPPH and FRAP) and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Proton nuclear magnetic reso-nance (1H NMR)-based metabolomics approach was employed to differentiate the most active extracts based on their metabolite profiles and correlation with bioactivities. Results and conclusions. The FD rhizome extracted with \u03a6(ethanol,water)=100:0 was observed to have potent TPC expressed as gallic acid equivalents, FRAP expressed as Trolox equivalents and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity with values of (45.4\u00b12.1) mg/g extract, (147.7\u00b18.3) mg/g extract and (265.5\u00b138.6) \u00b5g/mL (IC50), respectively. Meanwhile, for DPPH scavenging activity, the \u03a6(ethanol,water)=80:20 and 100:0 extracts of FD rhizome showed the highest activity with no significant difference between them. Hence, the FD rhizome extracts were selected for fur-ther metabolomics analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear discrimination among the different extracts. Partial least square (PLS) analysis showed positive correlations of the metabolites, including xanthorrhizol deriva-tive, 1-hydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-(6E)-6-heptene-3,4-dione, valine, luteolin, zedoardiol, \u03b2-turmerone, selina-4(15),7(11)-dien-8-one, zedoalac-tone B and germacrone, with the antioxidant and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition activ-ities, whereas curdione and 1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-(lE,6E)-1,6-heptadiene3,4-dione were correlated with \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Novelty and scientific contribution. C. caesia rhizome and leaf extracts con-tained phenolic compounds and had various antioxidant and \u03b1-glucosidase in-hibitory capacities. These findings strongly suggest that the rhizomes of C. caesia are an invaluable natural source of active ingredients for applications in pharma-ceutical and food industries. \u00a9 2023, University of Zagreb.

A range of cultivars has therefore been developed in response to customer preferences. In Japan, farmers may grow several cultivars to produce different types of tea. Leaf chlorophyll content is affected by disease, nutrition, and environmental factors. It also affects the color of the dried tea leaves: a higher chlorophyll content improves their appearance. The ability to quantify chlorophyll content would therefore facilitate improved tea tree management. Here, we measured the hyperspectral reflectance of 38 cultivars using a compact spectrometer. We also compared various combinations of preprocessing techniques and 14 variable selection methods. According to the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), detrending was effective at reducing the influence of additive interference of scattered light from particles and then regression coefficients was the best variable selection method for estimating the chlorophyll content of tea leaves, achieving an RPD of 2.60 and a root mean square error of 3.21 \u03bcg cm\u22122. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Yet, little information is available on how plant water status will respond to the combination of water deficit and increased air temperature in fruit tree species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the individual responses of deficit irrigation and warming and their combination on plant water status during the late winter and spring in young olive trees. Two temperature and two irrigation levels were applied in open top chambers during the late winter and spring of 2018 and 2019 to two- or three-year-old, potted trees (cv. Arbequina in 2018; Coratina in 2019). The temperature levels were a near-ambient control and a warming treatment that was 4 \u00b0C above the control, while the two irrigation levels were 100% and 50% of irrigation needs. Midday stem water potential (\u03a8s), stomatal conductance, net leaf photosynthesis, transpiration, and leaf temperature were measured periodically, and the difference between leaf and air temperature (\u0394T) was calculated. The \u03a8s generally decreased due to irrigation deficit and warming when applied individually. When both treatments were combined, an additive response was observed. In contrast, stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis were consistently decreased by deficit irrigation, but were less affected by warming. Irrigation deficit did not affect leaf temperature under our experimental conditions. As was expected, warming most often increased leaf temperature, but it also significantly decreased \u0394T early in the season when leaf transpiration appeared to be greater due to warming. The results indicate that modifications in water management with global warming will likely be required given the mostly negative individual or additive effects of irrigation deficit and air temperature on \u03a8s and other variables. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

The conventional materials often utilized for soil and ground improvement come with major challenges of large carbon footprints and some negative environmental impacts. As a result, suitable eco-friendly and sustainable materials are necessary. In this study, the potential use of Rice Husk Powder (RHP), Cassava Peel Powder (CPP) and Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC), as biopolymer-based materials to improve the engineering properties of a regional clay was investigated using a gamut of geotechnical compaction, strength and hydraulic conductivity tests according to BS 1377, 1990. The results revealed that locally sourced CPP performed better than both imported CMC and local RHP in improving the engineering properties of the regional clay. The shear strength value of the natural clayey soil (43.5 kPa) increased twenty and ten times respectively when treated with CPP (893 kPa) and CMC (450 kPa). One percent content of CPP and CMC performed optimally among the (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2 and 2.5) percent studied in improving the engineering properties of the case study regional clay. \u00a9 2022"

Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa) shows potential for cropping in water-limited environments, but studies into its water use and drought tolerance are conflicting. We evaluated the morphological, physiological and biochemical responses of the industrial hemp cultivar \u2018Black Label\u2019 to extreme and moderate water deficit in an 85-day greenhouse experiment. Under water deficit, hemp reduced biomass production and total seed yield, but maintained filled seeds for effective reproduction. Water use efficiency, measured using \u03b413C isotope analysis, increased under water deficit due to reductions in stomatal opening and transpiration. Water deficit increased proline accumulation, likely to allow osmotic adjustment. While extreme water deficit initiated water stress responses in hemp, plants were able to survive and maintain seed production. We report that hemp can survive at exceptionally low levels of soil water availability, which could have far-reaching consequences as agricultural industries pursue innovative, sustainable and water-efficient crops for the future. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V."

The polyisoprenoid distribution in the leaves was detected and regarded as two types. Type-II, showing the existence of both polyprenols and dolichols, was discovered in C. anagyroides leaves only. Type-III, displaying a predominance of polyprenol over dolichol was found in the leaves of L. leucochepala, S. saman, and T. indicus. By contrast, no type-I, which depicting the dominating dolichol over polyprenol was not identified in this analysis. The present study supported the previous findings on the world leaves that polyprenols but not dolichols are richly found. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

They must provide the energy and nutrients necessary for the organism - proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, fats (of animal and plant origin), etc. In some cases, menu planning must be consistent with the use of available food products or the use of interchangeable or similar foods. Problems arise when it comes to assessment and proving compliance with the quality and quantity standards of the products in the weekly menu plan. A commonly used solution is through the formal substitution of food products from the menu plan with the basic products defined by the norms.

We show using nine crystal structures, biochemical, and biophysical data that whereas these three proteins share similar overall folds, they exhibit different structural features that create three structurally and functionally unique enzyme active sites. Notably, quaternary structure plays an important role in creating distinct active site features that are hard to predict via structural modeling methods. The enzymes display differential processing capabilities toward glucuronic acid\u2013containing polysaccharides and SN-38-glucuronide, a metabolite of the cancer drug irinotecan. We also demonstrate that GUS-specific and nonselective inhibitors exhibit varying potencies toward each enzyme. Together, these data highlight the diversity of GUS enzymes within a single Bacteroides gut commensal and advance our understanding of how structural details impact the specific roles microbial enzymes play in processing drug-glucuronide and glycan substrates. \u00a9 2018 Pellock et al."

            "text": "Background: Effective enzymatic degradation of crystalline polysaccharides requires a synergistic cocktail of hydrolytic enzymes tailored to the wide-ranging degree of substrate crystallinity. To accomplish this type of targeted carbohydrate recognition, nature produces multi-modular enzymes, having at least one catalytic domain appended to one or more carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). The Type B CBM categorization encompasses several families (i.e., protein folds) of CBMs that are generally thought to selectively bind oligomeric polysaccharides; however, a subset of cellulose-specific CBM families (17 and 28) appear to bind non-crystalline cellulose more tightly than oligomers and in a manner that discriminates between surface topology. Results: To provide insight into this unexplained phenomenon, we investigated the molecular-level origins of oligomeric and non-crystalline carbohydrate recognition in cellulose-specific Type B CBMs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and free energy calculations. Examining two CBMs from three different families (4, 17, and 28), we describe how protein-ligand dynamics contribute to observed variations in binding affinity of oligomers within the same CBM family. Comparisons across the three CBM families identified factors leading to modified functionality prohibiting competitive binding, despite similarity in sequence and specificity. Using free energy perturbation with Hamiltonian replica exchange MD, we also examined the hypothesis that the open topology of the binding grooves in families 17 and 28 necessitates tight binding of an oligomer, while the more confined family 4 binding groove does not require the same degree of tight binding. Finally, we elucidated the mechanisms of non-crystalline carbohydrate recognition by modeling CBMs complexed with a partially decrystallized cellulose substrate. Molecular simulation provided structural and dynamic data for direct comparison to oligomeric modes of carbohydrate recognition, and umbrella sampling MD was used to determine ligand binding free energy. Comparing both protein-carbohydrate interactions and ligand binding free energies, which were in good agreement with experimental values, we confirmed the hypothesis that family 17 and 28 CBMs bind non-crystalline cellulose and oligomers with different affinities (i.e., high and low). Conclusions: Our study provides an unprecedented level of insight into the complex solid and soluble carbohydrate substrate recognition mechanisms of Type B CBMs, the findings of which hold considerable promise for enhancing lignocellulosic biomass conversion technology and development of plant cell wall probes. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

Superhydrophobic surfaces can also exhibit reduced friction, and liquids flowing over such surfaces have been found to slip in apparent violations of the classical no-slip boundary condition. Here we introduce slip into a model for rolling droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces and investigate under what conditions slip might be important for the steady-state motion. In particular, we examine three limiting cases in which dissipation in the rolling droplet is dominated by viscous dissipation, surface friction, or contact-line dissipation. We find that in molecular-dynamics simulations of droplets on ideal superhydrophobic surfaces with large effective slip lengths, contact-line dissipation dominates droplet motion. However, on real leaves, droplet motion is likely to be dominated by viscous shear, and slip, for the most part, can be neglected. \u00a9 2018 American Physical Society."

Both the CI and LAI can be obtained from global Earth Observation data from sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Here, the synergy between a MODIS-based CI and a MODIS LAI product is examined using the theory of spectral invariants, also referred to as photon recollision probability (\u2018p-theory\u2019), along with raw LAI-2000/2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer data from 75 sites distributed across a range of plant functional types. The p-theory describes the probability (p-value) that a photon, having intercepted an element in the canopy, will recollide with another canopy element rather than escape the canopy. We show that empirically-based CI maps can be integrated with the MODIS LAI product. Our results indicate that it is feasible to derive approximate p-values for any location solely from Earth Observation data. This approximation is relevant for future applications of the photon recollision probability concept for global and local monitoring of vegetation using Earth Observation data. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc."

The elastic modulus of sporopollenin is of great importance to understanding the adhesion, transport and protective functions of pollen grains. In addition, this fundamental mechanical property is of significant interest in using pollen exine as a material for drug delivery, reinforcing fillers, sensors and adhesives. Yet, the literature reports of the elastic modulus of sporopollenin are very limited. We provide the first report of the elastic modulus of sporopollenin from direct indentation of pollen particles of three plant species: Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), pecan (Carya illinoinensis) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis). The modulus was determined with atomic force microscopy by using direct nanomechanical mapping of the pollen shell surface. The moduli were atypically high for non-crystalline organic biomaterials, with average values of 16\u00b12.5 GPa (ragweed), 9.5\u00b12.3 GPa (pecan) and 16\u00b14.0 GPa (Kentucky bluegrass). The amorphous pollen exine has a modulus exceeding known non-crystalline biomaterials, such as lignin (6.7 GPa) and actin (1.8 GPa). In addition to native pollen, we have investigated the effects of exposure to a common preparative base-acid chemical treatment and elevated humidity on the modulus. Base-acid treatment reduced the ragweed modulus by up to 58% and water vapour exposure at 90% relative humidity reduced the modulus by 54% (pecan) and 72% (Kentucky bluegrass). These results are in agreement with recently published estimates of the modulus of base-acid-treated ragweed pollen of 8 GPa from fitting to mechanical properties of ragweed pollen-epoxy composites. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

Seagrass assessments also largely focus on shallow-water coastal habitats with comparatively few studies on offshore deep-water seagrasses. We satellite tracked green turtles (Chelonia mydas), which are known to forage on seagrasses, to a remote, pristine deep-water environment in the Western Indian Ocean, the Great Chagos Bank, which lies in the heart of one of the world's largest marine protected areas (MPAs). Subsequently we used in-situ SCUBA and baited video surveys to survey the day-time sites occupied by turtles and discovered extensive monospecific seagrass meadows of Thalassodendron ciliatum. At three sites that extended over 128 km, mean seagrass cover was 74% (mean range 67\u201388% across the 3 sites at depths to 29 m. The mean species richness of fish in seagrass meadows was 11 species per site (mean range 8\u201314 across the 3 sites). High fish abundance (e.g. Siganus sutor: mean MaxN.site\u22121 = 38.0, SD = 53.7, n = 5) and large predatory shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) (mean MaxN.site\u22121 = 1.5, SD = 0.4, n = 5) were recorded at all sites. Such observations of seagrass meadows with large top predators, are limited in the literature. Given that the Great Chagos Bank extends over approximately 12,500 km2 and many other large deep submerged banks exist across the world's oceans, our results suggest that deep-water seagrass may be far more abundant than previously suspected. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)"

However, decision makers are challenged by the complexity of fluctuating stream condition and irrigation quota as well as the dynamic changes of the field water cycle process, which make optimal allocation more complex. A two-stage chance-constrained programming model with random parameters in the left- and right-hand sides of constraints considering field water cycle process has been developed for agricultural irrigation water allocation. The model is capable of generating reasonable irrigation allocation strategies considering water transformation among crop evapotranspiration, precipitation, irrigation, soil water content, and deep percolation. Moreover, it can deal with randomness in both the right-hand side and the lefthand side of constraints to generate schemes under different flow levels and constraint-violation risk levels, which are informative for decision makers. The Yingke irrigation district in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwest China, was used to test the developed model. Tradeoffs among different crops in different time periods under different flow levels, and dynamic changes of soil moisture and deep percolation were analyzed. Scenarios with different violating probabilities were conducted to gain insight into the sensitivity of irrigation water allocation strategies on water supply and irrigation quota. The performed analysis indicated that the proposed model can efficiently optimize agricultural irrigation water for an irrigation district with water scarcity in a stochastic environment. \u00a9 2018 by the authors."

We have studied the effects of plant secondary metabolites on M. incognita locomotion, as it is an important factor affecting host inoculation inside the soil. We compared the effects to the respective behavioral responses of the model saprophytic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The tested botanical nematicides, all reported to be active against Meloidogyne sp. in our previous works, are small molecular weight molecules (acids, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones). Here, we specifically report on the attractant or repellent properties of trans-anethole, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, (E)-2-decenal, fosthiazate, and 2-undecanone. The treatments for both nematode species were made at sublethal concentration levels, namely, 1\u00a0mM (<EC50), and the chemical controls used for the experiments were the commercial nematicides fosthiazate and oxamyl. According to our results, trans-anethole, decenal, and oxamyl attract C. elegans, while 2-undecanone strongly attracts M. incognita. These findings can be of use in the development of nematicidal formulations, contributing to the disruption of nematode chemotaxis to root systems. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Among others, the Delicious group of apple is known for their health promoting and income generating attributes. However, the systematic investigation on morphological and phytochemical attributes of the apple growing in Indian Himalayan region is poorly known. An altitude-dependent variation in the fruit quality traits and phytochemical diversity was observed. The Royal Delicious was found rich in total tannin, flavonoids, flavonols, antioxidant activity [2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl, Ferric reducing antioxidant power], procyanidin B2, phloridzin and gallic acid; Red Delicious for total phenol and epicatechin and Golden Delicious for chlorogenic acid. The cultivar and altitude-dependent variation of phenolic profile in peel and pulp portion emphasizes genotype-specific biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in regulatory mechanisms. It is suggested that selection of suitable altitude and cultivars is required for harnessing the maximum phytochemical and antioxidant activity for benefits to human consumption. \u00a9 2018, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India)."

The inhibitory efficiency of the essential oil of the plant obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by GC and GC/MS was studied using gravimetric and electrochemical methods (polarization curves and electrochemical impedance). The effect of temperature on the corrosion behavior of the steel and the inhibitory efficiency was studied in a temperature range of 303\u2013323\u00a0K at 2\u00a0g/L. The surface morphology of the samples immersed in 1\u00a0M HCl for 24\u00a0h, before and after adding inhibitor at (2\u00a0g/L at 30\u00a0\u00b0C) was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) Quanta 250 with tungsten filament from the company FEI. Results show that the addition of the essential oil of the plant to the medium induces a diminish in the rate of corrosion and augmentation in the inhibitory efficiency of the oil. We established that the inhibition efficiency increase with concentration of the essential oil of lavender to attain 76.19% at 2\u00a0g/L. Polarization curves revealed that lavender oil react as a mixed-type inhibitor. EIS spectra exhibit one capacitive loop and confirm the inhibitive ability, and the changes in impedance parameters were indicative of adsorption of essential oil of lavender on the metal surface. The thermodynamic parameters indicate that the adsorption of the molecules of the oil takes place according to the Langmuir isotherm in the corrosive medium studied and that they are physisorbed on the metal surface. The analysis of the surface by electron microscopy demonstrates the absence of surface attack patterns in the presence of the oil. The results obtained from different tested techniques were in good agreement. \u00a9 2018, The Author(s)."

The whole seeds were removed from fruits directly after the harvest and were subjected to stratification (3 \u00b0C for 90 days in darkness) in distilled water or an aqueous solutions of 500 mM salicylic acid (SA), 10-3 M jasmonic acid (JA), gibberellin A3 (GA3) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) at 250 mg\u00b7dm-3 and 100 mg\u00b7dm-3, respectively. Growth regulators were applied separately or in a mixture containing SA, JA, GA3 and BAP. The germinability and seed germination rate, seedlings growth, chlorophyll content index and the maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm) were investigated. The obtained results revealed that stratification in water positively affected the dormancy removal in 'Gold Milenium', 'Ligol' and 'Szampion' seeds. Application of SA, GA3, BAP, JA during seed stratification additionally stimulated the seeds' germination rate as well as the growth of seedlings, index of chlorophyll content and maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm). The most pronounced results were obtained after the seed stratification in GA3 alone or in a mixture containing SA, GA3, BAP and JA. Due to such a treatment, the germination of 'Ligol' seeds increased by 40% and they germinated faster in comparison to the control seeds. Such treatments also promoted the growth of seedlings, chlorophyll content and maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm). The present study indicates that the application of GA3 or the mixture of SA, GA3, BAP and JA during the stratification of seeds is an effective method to increase and accelerate the germination of seeds and juvenile seedlings' growth in order to shorten the apple breeding cycle. Further studies are needed to optimize the appropriate concentration of growth regulators applied simultaneously during seeds stratification. \u00a9 2018 Krzysztof G\u00f3rnik et al., published by Sciendo."

            "text": "Plant defense against herbivores is modulated by herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) from oral secretions (OS) and/or saliva of insects. Furthermore, feeding wounds initiate plant self-damage responses modulated by danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as immune defense-promoting plant elicitor peptides (Peps). While temporal and spatial co-existence of both patterns during herbivory implies a possibility of their close interaction, the molecular mechanisms remain undetermined. Here we report that exogenous application of rice (Oryza sativa) peptides (OsPeps) can elicit multiple defense responses in rice cell cultures. Specific activation of OsPROPEP3 gene transcripts in rice leaves by wounding and OS treatments further suggests a possible involvement of the OsPep3 peptide in rice\u2013herbivore interactions. Correspondingly, we found that simultaneous application of OsPep3 and Mythimna loreyi OS significantly amplifies an array of defense responses in rice cells, including mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and generation of defense-related hormones and metabolites. The induction of OsPROPEP3/4 by OsPep3 points to a positive auto-feedback loop in OsPep signaling which may contribute to additional enhancement of defense signal(s). Finally, the overexpression of the OsPep receptor OsPEPR1 increases the sensitivity of rice plants not only to the cognate OsPeps but also to OS signals. Our findings collectively suggest that HAMP\u2013DAMP signal integration provides a critical step in the amplification of defense signaling in plants. \u00a9 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Place-based approaches study local and contemporary dynamics of the agricultural system, whereas climate impact modelling simulates climate-crop interactions across temporal and spatial scales. Crop-climate modelling and place-based research on adaptation were strategically reviewed and analysed to identify areas of commonality, differences, and potential learning opportunities to enhance the relevance of both disciplines through interdisciplinary approaches. Crop-modelling studies have projected a 7\u201315% mean yield change with adaptation compared to a non-adaptation baseline (Nature Climate Change 4:1\u20135, 2014). Of the 17 types of adaptation strategy identified in this study as place-based adaptations occurring within Central America, only five were represented in crop-climate modelling literature, and these were as follows: fertiliser, irrigation, change in planting date, change in cultivar and area cultivated. The breath and agency of real-life adaptation compared to its representation in modelling studies is a source of error in climate impact simulations. Conversely, adaptation research that omits assessment of future climate variability and impact does not enable to provide sustainable adaptation strategies to local communities so risk maladaptation. Integrated and participatory methods can identify and reduce these sources of uncertainty, for example, stakeholder\u2019s engagement can identify locally relevant adaptation pathways. We propose a research agenda that uses methodological approaches from both the modelling and place-based approaches to work towards climate-informed locally relevant adaptation. \u00a9 2018, The Author(s)."

            "text": "Increased water demands and drought have resulted in the need to provide data to guide deficit water management decisions in irrigated sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) production. The objective of this study was to quantify the yield response of sugarbeet to water input and actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) on a soil type (silt loam) common to sugarbeet production in the Northwest U.S. These relationships are valuable to understanding sugarbeet response over a range of water availability and in developing tools to assess future production under water shortages. This paper consolidates data from three studies consisting of ten site-years from 2009 to 2016. The studies were at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service facility in Kimberly, ID on a Portneuf silt loam soil. Treatments consisted of varying levels of cumulative seasonal Kimberly-Penman ET model estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) rates ranging from rain-fed to 125% of ETc. Irrigation methods consisted of surface drip irrigation (3 site-years), linear/pivot overhead sprinkler (6 site-years), and solid-set sprinkler (1 site-year). Irrigation frequency was consistent for all studies with applications occurring 2\u20133 times per week depending on ETc demand. Estimated recoverable sucrose (ERS) yield and root yield were measured, and soil water contents were measured. Across all site-years, quantitative relationships between both actual crop ET (ETa) and water input, and sugarbeet yield and quality variables were developed. Significant (0.05 probability level) positive linear relationships were found between ETa and sugarbeet ERS and root yields (r2 = 0.78). Estimated recoverable sucrose and root yields increased at rates of 19.4 kg ha\u22121 mm\u22121 ETa and 0.13 Mg ha\u22121 mm\u22121 ETa, respectively. When ETa depths of 719 and 729 mm were reached by the crop, root and ERS yields were maximized, respectively. When water input (irrigation + precipitation) depths of 598 and 605 mm were applied root and ERS yields were maximized, respectively. The quantitative relationships between both ETa and water input, and sugarbeet yields can be used to quantify sugarbeet production under deficit irrigation conditions (data derived from pivot/linear, drip, and solid set irrigation types), which may arise due to water shortage scenarios, or when drought occurs in non-irrigated areas. \u00a9 2018"

Caffeoylquinic acid derivatives and flavonoids were detected in the aqueous, alcohol, and ethyl acetate extracts. In DPPH assay, the methanol extracts exhibited the highest activity. TEAC assay resulted with superiority of all methanol and the capitula ethyl acetate extract. In \u03b2-carotene bleaching assay, linoleic acid was the best protected by the ethyl acetate extract of flower. The flower oil inhibited higher acetylcholinesterase activity than the remaining extracts. The flower ethyl acetate extract was found as the most effective inhibitor of \u03b1-amylase.

The establishment of a kinetic model was based on the theory of Fick\u2019s Rule and Noyes\u2013Whitney equation. By fitting the kinetic parameters of dissolution models, calculating the inherent parameters and the dissolution efficiency in herbal medicine, the results can be used to evaluate phytochemical constituent dissolution. In this study, laetrile, ferulic acid, and paeoniflorin were considered as three marker compounds, which were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The dissolution processes and results with BYHWD were described and evaluated by these kinetics models. The results showed that the AUC (area under the curve) for open system was 9.21 times higher than the closed system. Decomposition power (Dp) in the open system was 1.505 times higher than the closed system, and the calculated transfer power (TP) for the open system was 1.23 times higher than the closed system. \u00a9 2018, Dissolution Technologies Inc.

Perhaps less well-known is the growing body of evidence suggesting that organic acids play a key function in plant development and, in particular, in fruit development, maturation and ripening. Here, we critically review the connection between organic acids and the development of both climacteric and non-climacteric fruits. By analyzing the metabolic content of different fruits during their ontogenetic trajectory, we noticed that the content of organic acids in the early stages of fruit development is directly related to the supply of substrates for respiratory processes. Although different organic acid species can be found during fruit development in general, it appears that citrate and malate play major roles in this process, as they accumulate on a broad range of climacteric and non-climacteric fruits. We further highlight the functional significance of changes in organic acid profile in fruits due to either the manipulation of fruit-specific genes or the use of fruit-specific promoters. Despite the complexity behind the fluctuation in organic acid content during fruit development and ripening, we extend our understanding on the importance of organic acids on fruit metabolism and the need to further boost future research. We suggest that engineering organic acid metabolism could improve both qualitative and quantitative traits of crop fruits. \u00a9 2018 Batista-Silva, Nascimento, Medeiros, Nunes-Nesi, Ribeiro, Zs\u00f6g\u00f6n and Ara\u00fajo."

Here, we assessed whether ecological divergence has enhanced the diversification of the Neotropical alpine plant complex Espeletia, also known as frailejones. This genus has one of the highest diversification rates ever reported and is distributed in the world\u2019s fastest evolving biodiversity hotspot, the P\u00e1ramo (Neotropical alpine grasslands at elevations of c. 2800\u20134700 m). Our goal was to determine whether ecology plays a role in divergence within the Espeletia complex by quantifying genome-wide patterns of ecological divergence. We characterized 162 samples of the three most common and contrasting ecotypes (distinct morphotypes occupying particular habitats) co-occurring in six localities in the northern Andes using Genotyping by Sequencing. Contrasting ecotypes were caulescent cloud forest populations, caulescent populations from wind-sheltered and well-irrigated depressions and acaulescent populations from wind-exposed drier slopes. We found high polymorphism with a total of 1,273 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that defined the relationships among nine genetic clusters. We quantified allelic associations of these markers with localities and habitats using 18 different general and mixed-effects statistical models that accounted for phylogenetic distance. Despite that these models always yielded more SNPs associated with the localities, markers associated with the habitat types were recovered too. We found strong evidence for isolation-by-distance (IBD) across populations despite rampant gene flow, as expected for plant groups with limited seed dispersal. Contrasts between populations of different habitat types showed that an isolation-by-environment (IBE) trend emerged and masked the IBD signal. Maximum likelihood estimation of the number of migrants per generation (Nem) among ecotypes confirmed the IBE pattern. This result illustrates the importance of mountains\u2019 environmental variation at a local scale in generating rapid morphological radiations and maintaining multiple adaptations in a fast-evolving ecosystem like the P\u00e1ramo. \u00a9 2018 Cort\u00e9s, Garz\u00f3n, Valencia and Madri\u00f1\u00e1n."

The optimum essential oil yield was obtained using hydro distillation method (8.18 \u00b1 0.15 %). The essential oils isolated through different extraction methods contained remarkable amounts of total phenolics and total flavonoids. Essential oil isolated through supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction exhibited better antioxidant activity with highest free radical scavenging potential (96.16 \u00b1 1.57 %), inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation (94.18 \u00b1 1.47 %) and hydrogen peroxide free radical scavenging potential (68.25 \u00b1 1.02 %). Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of essential oils was performed through well diffusion, resazurin microtiter plate and micro dilution broth assay assays. The essential oil isolated through steam distillation method revealed highest antimicrobial activity with maximum inhibition zone (24.21 \u00b1 0.34 to12.08 \u00b1 0.30 mm) and least MIC values (35.18 \u00b1 0.77 to 281.46 \u00b1 7.03 \u00b5g/mL).

            "text": "Intercropping has historically been employed as an efficient management strategy to prevent disease outbreaks. Our previous studies indicated that intercropping of peanut with the Chinese medicinal herb, Atractylodes lancea effectively suppressed soil-borne peanut diseases, resulting in increased peanut yields. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this study, the below ground effects of A. lancea on both fungal and bacterial communities in the peanut rhizosphere were investigated using pyrosequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) and16S rRNA gene amplicons, respectively. Closed cultivation systems were constructed to investigate the role of volatiles and exudates originating from rhizomes and roots of A. lancea on fungal and bacterial communities. Intercropping with A. lancea significantly altered fungal community composition in the peanut rhizosphere, coinciding with decline of Fusarium root rot and improvement of peanut growth. Volatiles originating from A. lancea rhizome material had more effects on fungal communities than on bacterial communities, and significantly suppressed F. oxysporum growth. Root exudates of A. lancea had no apparent inhibitory effect on F. oxysporum. Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed 21 volatiles originating from A. lancea rhizome material and terpenes and aromatic hydrocarbons were the most common types. Our results suggest that A. lancea suppressed pathogenic Fusarium populations by means of volatiles from the rhizome. Our results support the idea that intercropping with A. lancea or use of its effective components has a strong potential for managing soil-borne fungal diseases. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

These unusual C28 steranes, termed cryostanes, seem to be restricted to pre-Snowball Earth sediments. We report their conclusive identification as 26-methyl cholestanes based on comparison of gas chromatographic (GC) behavior and mass spectrum of the last eluting cryostane isomer with those of a 26-methyl 5\u03b1(H),14\u03b1(H),17\u03b1(H),20R-cholestane standard obtained by way of synthesis. Sterols methylated at C-26 seem to be restricted to some demosponges and, based on molecular clock estimates, demosponges may have emerged in the time interval 800\u2013700 Ma. A sponge origin of cryostanes is thereby conceivable, making cryostanes the oldest molecular markers for animals. However, other biological sources need to be explored, including the wide variety of eukaryotic protists. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

            "text": "Coffee production has long been culturally and economically important in Puerto Rico. However, since peaking in the late nineteenth century, harvests are near record lows with many former farms abandoned. While value-added markets present new opportunities to reinvigorate the industry, regional trends associated with climate change may threaten the ability to produce high-quality coffee. Here, we discuss the history of coffee in Puerto Rico, outline important bioclimatic parameters, and model current and future habitat suitability using statistically downscaled climate data. Model projections suggest that warming trends may surpass important temperature thresholds during the coming decades. Under high (A2) and mid-low (A1B) emission scenarios for 2011\u20132040, Puerto Rico is projected to exceed mean annual temperature parameters for growth of Coffea arabica. Warming and drying trends may accelerate after 2040 and could result in top producing municipalities losing 60\u201384% of highly suitable growing conditions by 2070. Under the A2 scenario, Puerto Rico may only retain 24\u00a0km2 of highly suitable conditions by 2071\u20132099. High temperatures and low precipitation levels can result in diminished quality and yields, as well as increased exposure and sensitivity to certain insects and diseases. The climate data and models used are based on best current understanding of climate and emission interactions with results best interpreted as projected climate trends rather than predictions of future weather. Planning, innovation, and adaptation provide promising avenues to address current and future socioecological challenges while building a model of sustainable and resilient coffee production in Puerto Rico and throughout the region. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA)."

In order to select phytochemicals that best describe the antioxidant activity, classification, and regression analysis were conducted. Generalized pair correlation method (GPCM) gave insight which phytochemicals are the most important for the antioxidant activity prediction. That was confirmed using multiple linear regression (MLR) and establishing models that were validated. The sum of ranking differences (SRD) was applied in order to obtain and rank models with best predictive power. Both GPCM and MLR showed that the most important phytochemicals for the antioxidant activity prediction are chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a + b, and total carotenoids content. The obtained results should be considered as preliminary for the prediction of the antioxidant activity and further improvement in scientific research on this subject follows. Practical applications: The models for the prediction of the antioxidant activity were obtained. Novel approach for variable selection was conducted and new method for the MLR model ranking was applied. Chemometric guidelines for the selection of lettuce cultivars with increased antioxidant activity were defined. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Results showed that high variability occurred in the physicochemical properties of the fruits, including fruit size, 100-aril weight, juice yield, titratable acidity (TA), total reducing sugar (TS), total soluble solids (TSS), and TS/TA. Comparison of the distribution of the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities in the peels, juices, and seeds revealed that the pomegranate peels possessed much more phenolic components and stronger antioxidant activities than the seeds and juices. The phenolic components of pomegranate peels were structurally identified and quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrum (UPLC\u2013DAD\u2013ESI/MSn), and punicalagin (\u03b1- and \u03b2-isomers) was found as the predominant phenolic component. Correlation analysis revealed that the antioxidant activities were highly positively correlated with the total phenolics and flavonoids. The above results indicated that the pomegranate peel was the most valuable part because of abundant total phenolics and high antioxidant activities, and the best cultivar for fresh consumption, juice extraction, and bioactive components preparation was \u201cSD-QP.\u201d. \u00a9 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

To identify genes related to the biological characteristics of tetraploid Paulownia, transcriptome and small RNA sequencing were used to identify the key gene expression regulation in tetraploid Paulownia fortunei and tetraploid P. tomentosa and their corresponding diploids. A total of 1977 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 89 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) (38 conserved and 51 novel) were obtained in tetraploid vs. diploid comparisons of the two Paulownia species, and 18 target genes were identified by target prediction. Finally, by analyzing the expression profiles of the DEGs and DEMs and their target genes, we discovered that Pau-miR169, Pau-miR408 and Pau-miR156 interacted with their target gene nuclear transcription factor Y subunit A-9 (NF-YA9), serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1) and s-adenosyl-methionine-sterol-c-methyltransfera-se (SAM:SMT) to regulate the abiotic stress tolerance and the timber quality of the tetraploid Paulownia.

Here, we investigated the genetic patterns of one of the most widespread and abundant mangrove species in the Indo-West Pacific, Sonneratia alba J. Sm., in order to gain insights into the ecological and evolutionary drivers of genetic structure in mangroves. We employed 11 nuclear microsatellite loci and two chloroplast regions to genotyped 25 S. alba populations. Our objectives were to (1) assess the level of genetic diversity and its geographic distribution; and (2) determine the genetic structure of the populations. Our results revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations. We detected a major genetic break between Indo-Malesia and Australasia, and further population subdivision within each oceanic region in these two major clusters. The phylogeographic patterns indicated a strong influence of vicariance, oceanic barriers and geographic distance on genetic structure. In addition, we found low genetic diversity and high genetic drift at range edge. This study advances the scope of mangrove biogeography by demonstrating a unique scenario whereby a widespread species has limited dispersal and high genetic divergence among populations. \u00a9 2017 by the authors."

            "text": "Introduction: A fundamental challenge to the integrity of tropical dry forest ecosystems is the invasion of non-native grass species. These grasses compete for resources and fuel anthropogenic wildfires. In 2012, a bulldozer from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority cleared a 570-m\u00a0trail from a state road into a mature dry forest section of Gu\u00e1nica Forest to control a wildfire. We monitored colonization by a non-native invasive grass (Megathyrsus maximus), a highly invasive tree (Leucaena leucocephala), and a native grass (Uniola virgata), as well as natural regeneration, along the bulldozer trail. We determined whether bulldozing facilitated colonization by these species into the forest and the extent of spread. Results: Distance from propagule source and temporal variations strongly influenced colonization by our three focal species. Megathyrsus maximus invaded along the trail from source populations by the state road. The establishment of new colonies of M. maximus seedlings went as far as 570\u00a0m inside the forest (i.e., at the end of the bulldozer trail), but we found most new colonies within 270\u00a0m of the road. Leucaena leucocephala exhibited a similar spreading pattern. Before disturbance, Uniola virgata was distributed widely across the forest, but the highest densities were found in areas near the latter portion (> 401\u00a0m) of the bulldozer trail. Subsequently, the species formed new clumps along more than half of the trail (250 to 570\u00a0m), apparently colonizing from undisturbed patches nearby. Conclusions: Bulldozing facilitated the invasion of non-native vegetation. The projected community assemblage will be more fire-prone than before since M. maximus carries fire across the landscape better than U. virgata, emphasizing the capacity of invasive plant colonization to alter local ecological processes after only a single wildfire and bulldoze event. Our results provide a valuable baseline for short-term vegetation response to anthropogenic disturbances in tropical semi-deciduous dry forests. \u00a9 2017, The Author(s)."

Drying characteristics and changes in contents of moisture, anthocyanin, total phenolics, vitamin C, and antioxidant activity in the blueberries during drying were investigated. The effects of PEF-pretreatment on drying efficiency and nutritive quality of blueberries were dependent on drying methods and temperatures. The PEF-pretreatment before vacuum drying significantly (p <.05) reduced the drying time of blueberry samples, from 6 to 4 hr, 10 to 7 hr, and 70 to 40 hr at 75, 60, and 45\u00b0C, respectively. The PEF-pretreatment did not significantly (p >.05) influence the retention of nutritional values before drying and also had the least impact on the nutritive quality of dried samples during vacuum drying at 75\u00b0C as compared with controls. The Weibull model fitted the drying data of blueberries well. Practical applications: Drying or dehydration is a popular method to preserve fruits, but it is a time consuming process and could cause the loss of quality and nutritive values. In this study, fresh blueberries were pretreated with pulsed electric fields (PEF) and then dried. The PEF pretreatment significantly increased the drying efficiency, reducing the drying time by 2\u201330 hr, and did not significantly influence on the nutritive quality. The PEF pretreatment could save production cost significantly by saving labor and energy while it would affect the nutritive quality of dried blueberries. Therefore, PEF pretreatment has great potential for industrial applications. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

            "text": "Background: One of the major barriers to the development of lignocellulosic feedstocks is the recalcitrance of plant cell walls to deconstruction and saccharification. Recalcitrance can be reduced by targeting genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, but this can have unintended consequences that compromise the agronomic performance of the trees under field conditions. Here we report the results of a field trial of fourteen distinct transgenic Populus deltoides lines that had previously demonstrated reduced recalcitrance without yield penalties under greenhouse conditions. Results: Survival and productivity of the trial were excellent in the first year, and there was little evidence for reduced performance of the transgenic lines with modified target gene expression. Surprisingly, the most striking phenotypic effects in this trial were for two empty-vector control lines that had modified bud set and bud flush. This is most likely due to somaclonal variation or insertional mutagenesis. Traits related to yield, crown architecture, herbivory, pathogen response, and frost damage showed few significant differences between target gene transgenics and empty vector controls. However, there were a few interesting exceptions. Lines overexpressing the DUF231 gene, a putative O-acetyltransferase, showed early bud flush and marginally increased height growth. Lines overexpressing the DUF266 gene, a putative glycosyltransferase, had significantly decreased stem internode length and slightly higher volume index. Finally, lines overexpressing the PFD2 gene, a putative member of the prefoldin complex, had a slightly reduced volume index. Conclusions: This field trial demonstrates that these cell wall modifications, which decreased cell wall recalcitrance under laboratory conditions, did not seriously compromise first-year performance in the field, despite substantial challenges, including an outbreak of a stem boring insect (Gypsonoma haimbachiana), attack by a leaf rust pathogen (Melampsora spp.), and a late frost event. This bodes well for the potential utility of these lines as advanced biofuels feedstocks. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s)."

This effector-triggered immunity has been recently exploited to generate extreme resistance to late blight in potato by genetic engineering. The choice of the R genes, their number forming a R gene stack, and the pathogen Avr gene diversity will likely determine how long this extreme resistance will last. Here, we report on a comparative study on the Rpi-vnt1.1 gene which originated from Solanum venturii, and was introduced in the potato variety \u2018Desiree\u2019 by genetic transformation, and the Avr-vnt1 gene from two isolates of the EC-1 lineage of P. infestans. EC-1 was reported previously as not expressing the Avr-vnt1 gene and, therefore, being virulent on Rpi-vnt1.1 transgenic plants. Unexpectedly, whole-plant resistance assays identified 5 out of 52 transgenic events as resistant to two isolates of P. infestans, POX067 and POX109, belonging to the EC-1 lineage. We demonstrated that in both isolates, the Avr-vnt1.1 gene was expressed at a low level. Expression of the Rpi-vnt1.1 gene was shown to be rapidly increased by two-fold and subsequently to have steady state expression for at least 5 days after the inoculation. The Rpi-vnt1.1 gene in addition to other R genes as a stack in farmers\u2019 preferred varieties will confer extreme resistance to late blight disease and rotations of plants with different R-gene-stack in time is likely to last longer than plants with single R gene. \u00a9 2017, The Author(s)."

            "text": "Low-input grassland biomass from marginal and other slightly more fertile sites can be used for energy production without competing with food or fodder production. The effect of grassland diversity on methane yield has received some attention, but we do not know how community assembly may affect methane yield from grassland biomass. However, methane yields determine the potential economic value of a bioenergy substrate. Hence, a better understanding of how plant community assembly affects methane yield would be important. We measured biomass production and methane yield in the second year of a grassland field experiment which manipulated the order of arrival of different plant functional groups (forbs, grasses or legumes sown first and all sown simultaneously) and sown diversity (9 vs. 21 species). The order of arrival of the plant functional groups significantly determined the relative dominance of each group which in turn mainly explained the variance in aboveground biomass production. Differences in area-specific methane yields were driven by differences in biomass production and which plant functional groups dominated a plot. When grasses were sown first, legumes and grasses codominated a plot and the highest area-specific methane yield was obtained. Overall, the results indicate that altering the order of arrival affected the community functional and species composition (and hence methane yields) much more than sown diversity. Our study shows that a combined use of positive biodiversity effects and guided plant community assembly may be able to optimize methane yields under field conditions. This may allow a guided, sustainable, and lucrative use of grassland biomass for biogas production in the future. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Moench] has been identified as a high yielding bioenergy feedstock crop on the continental USA, there is however lack of conclusive data on its performance in Hawaii (HI). The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the adaptability and productivity of two biomass sorghum hybrids, and (ii) identify the associated crop parameter attributes and environmental factors for high biomass yields. Two comparative trials were conducted, one on Maui island, HI and the other at Temple, Texas (TX). At Temple, the biomass sorghum hybrids responded as expected, growing to heights in excess of 3 m and producing average biomass yields of 37.4 Mg ha\u22121. The high leaf area indices (LAI, 7.8\u20139.8) intercepted over 90% incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at LAI > 4, while the computed average light extinction coefficient (k) was 0.48. An average plant growth rate (PGR) of 189 kg dry biomass ha\u22121 day-1 was achieved, while the average radiation use efficiency (RUE) was 2.75 g MJ\u22121. In sharp contrast to the results obtained at Temple, the two sorghum hybrids planted on Maui behaved like photoperiod insensitive short day grain sorghums; lower plant heights (<2.0 m), LAI (average, 3.8) and PGR prior to heading (average, 41 kg ha\u22121 day-1), flowered early (\u223c90 days after planting), and had aboveground biomass yields reduced by 76%. The study underscored the importance of not only choosing the right bioenergy crop species, but also the suitability of target environments, planting date and management practices. The crop parameters determined at Temple can be incorporated into crop and environmental simulation models such as ALMANAC, EPIC/APEX and SWAT to model various biomass sorghum cropping systems and their associated environmental impacts. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V."

In addition, the microstructures of the untreated specimen and the fire-retardant treated specimen after cone calorimeter testing were determined by scanning electron microscopy. Combustion gas toxicity was evaluated according to the test method described in Naval Engineering Standard 713 (1990). The emitted combustion gases of all specimens were carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOX), and acrylonitrile. The thermal decomposition rate was reduced by about one-third that of the fire-retardant treated specimen compared to the reduction rate of the untreated specimen. These results are useful for guiding the safe utilization of fire retardant-treated wood and wood-based materials for building applications."

The vegetation dynamics of these two peatlands were driven by autogenic processes reflecting the development trajectory of the peatlands towards ombrotrophic status, and allogenic climate change. We observe an increase in shrub pollen and macrofossils (e.g. Ericaceae, Betula nana) during two Late Holocene warm episodes and in recent decades. Pollen data suggest that regional forest cover also responded to temperature increase since ca. 1950 CE. An increase of Picea pollen (up to 13%) in the upper part of peat profile is probably associated with long distance pollen transport from populations of Picea mariana and Picea glauca located at the southern foothills of the Brooks Range. Relatively small amount of micro- and macrocharcoal in the two profiles indicates little fire activity around the sampling sites over the last ca. 2000 years, which is in agreement with regional findings. The lack of surface and groundwater influence under prolonged warmer/drier condition can allow Sphagnum to expand in Arctic peatlands. Cold climatic conditions might have been detrimental to Sphagnum populations, that were replaced by Carex spp. and other vascular plants owing to wetter conditions in the peatland. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

To investigate the genetic architecture of seed nutrients in upland cotton, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in a panel of 196 germplasm resources under three environments using a CottonSNP80K chip of 77,774 loci. Relatively high genetic diversity (average gene diversity being 0.331) and phenotypic variation (coefficient of variation, CV, exceeding 3.9%) were detected in this panel. Correlation analysis revealed that the well-documented negative association between seed protein (PR) and oil may be to some extent attributable to the negative correlation between oleic acid (OA) and PR. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was unevenly distributed among chromosomes and subgenomes. It ranged from 0.10\u20130.20 Mb (Chr19) to 5.65\u20135.75 Mb (Chr25) among the chromosomes and the range of Dt-subgenomes LD decay distances was smaller than At-subgenomes. This panel was divided into two subpopulations based on the information of 41,815 polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The mixed linear model considering both Q-matrix and K-matrix [MLM(Q+K)] was employed to estimate the association between the SNP markers and the seed nutrients, considering the false positives caused by population structure and the kinship. A total of 47 SNP markers and 28 candidate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regions were found to be significantly associated with seven cottonseed nutrients, including protein, total fatty acid, and five main fatty acid compositions. In addition, the candidate genes in these regions were analyzed, which included three genes, Gh_D12G1161, Gh_D12G1162, and Gh_D12G1165 that were most likely involved in the control of cottonseed protein concentration. These results improved our understanding of the genetic control of cottonseed nutrients and provided potential molecular tools to develop cultivars with high protein and improved fatty acid compositions in cotton breeding programs through marker-assisted selection. \u00a9 2018 Yuan, Wang, Wang, Xing, Wang, Saeed, Tao, Feng, Zhang, Song and Sun."

Preliminary evidence indicates that monocots store high levels of free nucleotides and nucleosides but their potential as a source of internal organic nitrogen for use and remobilization is uncharted. Early tillering wheat plants were therefore starved of N over a 5-day time-course with examination of nucleic acid yields in whole shoots, young and old leaves and roots. Nucleic acids constituted \u223c4% of the total N pool of N starved wheat plants, which was comparable with the N available from nitrate (NO3                             -) and greater than that available from the sum of 20 proteinogenic amino acids. Methods were optimized to detect nucleotide (purine and pyrimidine) metabolites, and wheat orthologs of RNA degradation (TaRNS), nucleoside transport (TaENT1, TaENT3) and salvage (TaADK) were identified. It was found that N starved wheat roots actively catabolised RNA and specific purines but accumulated pyrimidines. Reduced levels of RNA corresponded with induction of TaRNS2, TaENT1, TaENT3, and TaADK in the roots. Reduced levels of GMP, guanine, xanthine, allantoin, allantoate and glyoxylate in N starved roots correlated with accumulation of allantoate and glyoxylate in the oldest leaf, suggesting translocation of allantoin. Furthermore, N starved wheat plants exogenously supplied with N in the form of purine catabolites grew and photosynthesized as well as those plants re-supplied with NO3                             -. These results support the hypothesis that the nitrogen and carbon recovered from purine metabolism can support wheat growth. \u00a9 2018 Melino, Casartelli, George, Rupasinghe, Roessner, Okamoto and Heuer."

            "text": "Environmentally induced transgenerational plasticity can increase success of progeny and thereby be adaptive if progeny experiences the similarly parental environment. The ecological and evolutionary significance of transgenerational plasticity in plant has been studied mainly in the context of sexual generations. A pot experiment using the stoloniferous herb Centella asiatica was conducted to investigate the effects of high/low light treatment experienced by parental ramets (F0 generation) on morphological and physiological properties of offspring ramets (F2 generation) as well as growth performance. Light environment experienced by parental ramets (F0 generation) significantly influenced petiole length, specific petiole length, internode length of stolon, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll contents, potential maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pmax) in offspring ramets subjected to parental or non-parental environments even after they were detached from the parental ramets. Potential maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pmax) of offspring ramets (F2 generation) from parental ramets (F0 generation) subjected to low light treatment was significantly greater than that of offspring ramets (F2 generation) from parental ramets (F0 generation) subjected to high light treatment. Potential maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pmax) of offspring ramets (F2 generation) subjected to parental light environment was greater than that of offspring ramets (F2 generation) subjected to non-parental light environment. The greatest biomass accumulation and total stolon length were observed in offspring ramets (F2 generation) subjected to low light treatment as parental ramets (F0 generation) experienced. When parental ramets (F0 generation) were subjected to low light treatment, biomass accumulation and total stolon length of offspring ramets (F2 generation) experiencing parental light environment were significantly greater than those of offspring ramets (F2 generation) experiencing non-parental light environment. Opposite pattern was observed in offspring ramets (F2 generation) from parental ramets subjected to high light treatment. Our work provides evidence that transgenerational plasticity through both morphological and physiological flexibility was triggered across vegetative generations for stoloniferous herb C. asiatica subjected to high/low light treatment. The transgenerational plasticity can allow offspring ramets to present adaptive phenotype early without lag time in response to the current environment. Thus, it is very important for clonal plants in adapting temporally and spatially heterogeneous habitats. \u00a9 2018 Li, Chen, Wei, Li and Lei."

            "text": "Hancornia speciosa Gomes is a fruit tree, commonly known as the mangaba tree, which is widespread throughout Brazil. The leaves of this plant are used in traditional medicine for medicinal purposes. Thus, the objective of this study was to perform a physico chemical characterization, identify the lipophilic antioxidants and fatty acids, and determine the microbiological quality and safety of H. speciosa leaves. In addition, the antioxidant, antimutagenic, and inhibitory activities of the ethanolic extract of H. speciosa leaves (EEHS) against enzymes related to neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, obesity, and diabetes were investigated. Furthermore, this study aimed at assessing the in vivo effects of the EEHS on the glycemia of normoglycemic and diabetic Wistar rats. Physico chemical character ization was performed by colorimetry and gas-liquid chromato graphy with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The total number of colonies of aerobic mesophiles, molds, and yeasts was determined. The total coliforms and Escherichia coli were counted using the SimPlates kit, and sulphite-reducing Clostridium spores were quantified using the sulphite-polymyxin-sulfadiazine agar method. Salmonella spp. were detected using the 1-2 Test. The antioxidant activity of the EEHS was measured by its inhibition of 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydro chloride- (AAPH-) induced oxidative hemolysis of human erythrocytes. The antimutagenic activity was determined using the Ames test. The acetylcholine sterase, butyry lcholine sterase, tyrosinase, hyaluronidase, lipase, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b1-glycosidase enzyme-inhibiting activities were assessed and compared with commercial controls. The in vivo effects of the EEHS were assessed using the oral glucose tolerance test in normoglycemic Wistar rats and measuring the blood glucose levels in diabetic rats. The results demonstrated physical-chemical parameters of microbiological quality and safety in the leaves of H. speciosa, as well as antioxidant and antimutagenic activities and inhibition of enzymes related to neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, obesity, and diabetes. In in vivo assays, it was shown that the normoglycemic rats challenged with glucose overload show significantly decreased blood glucose levels when treated with the EEHS. Taken together, the results ensure the microbiological quality and safety as well as showing the contents of carotenoids and poly unsaturated fatty acids of H. speciosa leaves. Additionally, the antioxidant, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-Alzheimer's disease, anti-Parkinson's disease, antiobesity, and antihyperglycemic activities of the EEHS were demonstrated. \u00a9 2018 Uilson Pereira dos Santos et al."

            "text": "Proteases represent one of the three largest groups of industrial enzymes and account for about 60% of the total global enzymes sale. According to the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, proteases are classified in enzymes of class 3, the hydrolases, and the subclass 3.4, the peptide hydrolases or peptidase. Proteases are generally grouped into two main classes based on their site of action, that is, exopeptidases and endopeptidases. Protease has also been grouped into four classes based on their catalytic action: Aspartic, cysteine, metallo, and serine proteases. However, lately, three new systems have been defined: The threonine-based proteasome system, the glutamate-glutamine system of eqolisin, and the serine-glutamate-Aspartate system of sedolisin. Aspartic proteases (EC 3.4.23) are peptidases that display various activities and specificities. It has two aspartic acid residues (Asp32 and Asp215) within their active site which are useful for their catalytic activity. Most of the aspartic proteases display best enzyme activity at low pH (pH 3 to 4) and have isoelectric points in the pH range of 3 to 4.5. They are inhibited by pepstatin. The failure of the plant and animal proteases to meet the present global enzyme demand has directed to an increasing interest in microbial proteases. Microbial proteases are preferred over plant protease because they have most of the characteristics required for their biotechnological applications. Aspartic proteases are found in molds and yeasts but rarely in bacteria. Aspartic protease enzymes from microbial sources are mainly categorized into two groups: (i) the pepsin-like enzymes produced by Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Neurospora and (ii) the rennin-like enzymes produced by Endothia and Mucor spp., such as Mucor miehei, M. pusillus, and Endothia parasitica. Aspartic proteases of microbial origin have a wide range of application in food and beverage industries. These include as milk-clotting enzyme for cheese manufacturing, degradation of protein turbidity complex in fruit juices and alcoholic liquors, and modifying wheat gluten in bread by proteolysis. \u00a9 2018 Jermen Mamo and Fassil Assefa."

However, rich hyperspectral data are not fully utilized by traditional image analysis techniques. We integrated several recently developed machine learning algorithms to estimate DRC on plant leaves using the spectra measured by the ASD FieldSpec 3. The experiments were carried out on three common green plants of southern China. The important hyperspectral variables were first identified by applying the random forest (RF) algorithm. Three estimation models were then developed using the support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and RF algorithms. The results showed that the increase in dust retention contents on plant leaves enhanced their reflectance in the visible wavelength but weakened their reflectance in the infrared wavelength. Wavelengths in the ranges of 450-500 nm, 550-600 nm, 750-1000 nm, and 1100-1300 nm were identified as important variables using the RF algorithm and were used to estimate the DRC. The comparison of the three machine learning techniques for DRC estimation confirmed that the SVM and RF models performed well because their estimations were similar to the measured DRC. Specifically, the average R2 for SVM and RF model are 0.85 and 0.88. The technical approach of this study proved to be a successful illustration of using hyperspectral measurements to estimate the DRC on plant leaves. The findings of this study can be applied to monitor the DRC on leaves of other plants and can also be integrated with other types of spectral data to measure the DRC at a regional scale. \u00a9 2018 Wenlong Jing et al."

Pomegranate fruits (\u2018Mridula\u2019 and \u2018Bhagwa\u2019) were individually shrink wrapped using three semi-permeable films (Cryovac\u00ae BDF-2001, D-955 and normal LDPE) and stored at ambient (25\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C and 49\u201367% RH) and low temperature (8\u00a0\u00b0C and 75\u201380% RH). Shrink wrapping greatly reduced weight loss in both cultivars irrespective of the film used and storage temperature. Weight loss in shrink wrapped (D-955 film) \u2018Mridula\u2019 and \u2018Bhagwa\u2019 after 1\u00a0month storage at ambient temperature was respectively 1.40 and 1.05%, when compared to 22.92 and 22.53% in non-wrapped fruits. After 3\u00a0months at 8\u00a0\u00b0C, shrink wrapped \u2018Mridula\u2019 and \u2018Bhagwa\u2019 fruits lost only 0.43 and 0.68% weight respectively, compared to 17.23 and 21.67% in non-wrapped ones. Shrink wrapping significantly reduced the respiration rate at ambient temperature and the response varied with variety and film used. Shrink wrapped fruits of both cultivars retained the original peel colour (Hunter h\u2218 and C* values) to a maximum extent during 3\u00a0months storage at 8\u00a0\u00b0C and shelf-life period at ambient temperature. Irrespective of variety and film, shrink wrapping maintained the peel thickness and peel moisture content, significantly much higher than non-wrapped fruits at both temperatures. Compared to \u2018Mridula\u2019 cultivar, \u2018Bhagwa\u2019 responded well to shrink wrapping during prolonged storage at both temperatures with better maintenance of quality in terms of appearance, colour, juice content, TSS, acidity, sugars and sensory attributes. At ambient temperature, shrink wrapping with D-955 or LDPE film extended the storage life of \u2018Mridula\u2019 and \u2018Bhagwa\u2019 for 3\u00a0weeks and 1\u00a0month respectively, whereas at 8\u00a0\u00b0C both could be stored for 3\u00a0months with 3\u00a0days of shelf life. \u00a9 2017, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India)."

Results showed that the long maceration (LM) caused higher level of anthocyanins in wine, especially cyaniding-3-O-rutinoside, cyaniding-3-O-glucoside and dephinidin-3-O-glucoside, whereas the short maceration caused lower level of phenolic acids in wine. The medium maceration (MM) wine showed the highest level of flavonols but the lowest concentration of flavan-3-ol. The LM wine exhibited greater red tone and colour intensity accompanied by higher amounts of free and copigmented anthocyanins. The LM wine showed lower levels of alcohols, acids, terpenoids, benzenes and sulphur compounds, whereas the lowest level of esters was found in the MM wine. The LM wine had reduced fruity and floral aroma and overall flavour complexity compared with the other wines. Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling.

For this purpose, three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, YJM 681 (isolated from raspberry), ySR 127 (commercial yeast) and Y1 (isolated from kefir fermented milk) were used for the alcoholic fermentation of mulberry juice. Yeast strains had deep influences on oenological, phenolic, amino acid, volatile and sensory profiles of resulting mulberry wines. Specifically, the beverages fermented with YJM 681 were characterised by relatively high volatile acidity and high contents of total flavonols, amino acids and some phenolic acids, including protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid and veratric acid. Samples fermented with ySR 127 possessed higher cyanidin-3-O-glucoside content, whereas, total amino acid content was markedly lower than that of other samples. Furthermore, mulberry wines fermented with Y1 showed the lowest volatile acidity and the lowest contents of total anthocyanins and tartaric esters. The amounts of major aromatic compounds, including 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol and ethyl acetate inside were also smaller than that of samples fermented with YJM 681 and ySR 127. Besides, the sensory results revealed that mulberry wines fermented with Y1 exhibited the lowest intensity of fruity aroma, while samples fermented with ySR 127 had the strongest sour and sweet tastes and aftertaste. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the influence of yeast strains on the quality of mulberry wine. \u00a9 Yang Tao, Yilin Wang, Jun Yang, Qi Wang, Na Jiang, Dinh-Toi Chu, Yongbin Han, and Jianzhong Zhou."

The main aim of the present study was to track possible changes in genetic diversity of regenerating populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in areas subjected either to a natural disturbance (windthrows and subsequent clear-cutting of the affected spruce stand) or to a changed land-use legacy (pine regeneration on abandoned agricultural land) with the aim of testing whether the new forest generation retains the genetic diversity of the putative maternal stand. Eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to reveal the genetic diversity and its spatial distribution in the studied tree populations. Self-regenerating juveniles of Norway spruce and Scots pine were spatially random and as genetically diverse as in the putative maternal populations. Genetic differentiation between putatively maternal trees and regenerating juveniles was low for both species. A high genetic diversity and random spatial genetic structure revealed in the regenerating populations provides a basis for the formation of evolutionary and ecologically sound stands able to adapt to ever-changing climatic conditions. Information on the genetic dynamics of the studied natural populations of long-lived coniferous tree species may be important for evaluating possible changes in genetic diversity at a local scale following forest ecosystem disturbances and changes in land-use legacies. \u00a9 2017 by the authors."

            "text": "Carbon cycling is a key natural system that requires robust science literacy to understand how and why climate change is occurring. Studies show that students tend to compartmentalize carbon movement within plants and animals and are challenged to make sense of how carbon cycles on a global scale. Studies also show that students hold faulty models of climate change which thwart their reasoning about how and why climate change occurs. Very few studies have examined how to support students in understanding carbon cycling and reasoning about the relationships between carbon cycling and climate change. To support secondary students in making these connections, we developed a modeling-centered socio-scientific issue (SSI) based curriculum unit taught by the same teacher across three sections of a secondary biology class. At three time points within the 2-week unit, 50 students developed, used, evaluated, and revised their own carbon cycling models to use as sense-making tools for how individual biological processes create a global carbon system and the relationship between carbon cycling and climate change. A small subset of students (n = 16) were also interviewed about their models. We constructed holistic scoring rubrics to document students\u2019 model-based reasoning associated with each model and then compared rubric scores across time points to examine potential progression of model-based reasoning over the course of the unit. Results suggest that students\u2019 must hold a robust understanding of causal mechanisms for transfer and transformation of carbon in order to make connections between carbon cycling and climate change. Once their understanding of carbon cycling becomes robust, their reasoning shifts in complexity to understand interrelationships between carbon cycling and climate change. Implications from this study suggest that embedding the practices of modeling within a SSI unit supported secondary students in building robust understanding of carbon cycling and the interrelationship to climate change. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The scavenging activity of BSG oil was 71.60% and was more than its polar, nonpolar and unsaponified fractions (61.14, 52.42, and 34.47%). The IC50 of the BSG oil (7.39 \u00b5g\u00a0mL\u22121) was 1000 times lower than common antioxidants\u2014Ascorbic acid (2.86 mg\u00a0mL\u22121) and BHT (2.60 mg\u00a0mL\u22121), establishing its superior antioxidant activity. The total phenolic content of oil was found to be 1.22 mg GAE per ml of oil while its protein content was found to be between 10.2 and 11.0 mg\u00a0mL\u22121. EPR spectroscopy showed 100% quenching of DPPH at 0.5% (w/v) of oil. GCMS revealed the presence of anti-oxidants. The accelerated oxidation study showed acceptable values for peroxide (till 6 hr) and anisidine (1 hr) tests. Practical applications: Brewer' spent grain (BSG) comprises residual constituents of the brewing process that have been utilized for low value applications. The present study revealed a number of bioactive compounds (antioxidants and phenolic compounds) and volatiles in the BSG oil. The antioxidant functionality of this phytochemical rich extract can be utilized for nutraceutical applications to reduce free radical damage in humans. For food preservation, the oil can be employed to reduce browning, rancidity and other deterioration reactions. Thus oil extracted from waste by-product can be used for high value applications. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Abstract: The aim of this study was to examine if temperature conditions potentially causing frost damage have an effect on radial growth in Norway spruce and Scots pine\u00a0in Finland. We hypothesized that frost damage occurs and reduces radial growth after (1) extreme cold winter temperatures, (2) frost hardiness levels insufficient to minimum temperatures, and (3) the lack of insulating snow cover during freezing temperatures, resulting in increased frost and decreased temperatures in soil. Meteorological records were used to define variables describing the conditions of each hypothesis and a dynamic frost hardiness model was used to find events of insufficient frost hardiness levels. As frost damage is likely to occur only under exceptional conditions, we used generalized extreme value distributions to describe the frost variables. Our results did not show strong connections between radial growth and the frost damage events. However, significant growth reductions were found at some Norway spruce sites after events insufficient frost hardiness levels, and alternatively, after winters with high frost sum of snowless days. Scots pine did not show significant growth reductions associated with any of the studied variables. Thus, radial growth in Norway spruce may be more sensitive to future changes in winter conditions. Our results demonstrate that considering only temperature is unlikely to be sufficient in studying winter temperature effects on tree growth. Instead, understanding the effects of changing temperature and snow conditions in relation to tree physiology and phenology is needed. \u00a9 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."

            "text": "Stomata, formed by a pair of specialized guard cells, are present on the epidermis of most plant leaves. The regulation of stomatal apertures controls the exchange of moisture and gas between plants and the environment, and balances the carbon dioxide (CO2) entry into the plant for photosynthesis with water loss via transpiration. G-protein, a ubiquitous signaling molecule in eukaryotic cells, is an indispensable participator in the mechanism of stomatal movement. It was widely recognized that G-protein \u03b1 subunit (GPA1) can regulate a majority of signals during stomatal movement, such as Ca2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), H2O2, ethylene, and so on. On the other hand, guard cell microtubule (MT) dynamics play a comparably critical role in regulating stomatal movement, and MTs rearrangement has been observed in stomatal responses to a variety of stimuli, like light, dark, nitric oxide (NO). Both heterotrimeric G-protein and MTs are essential for abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells, but whether and how these two signaling components work together is poorly understood. Here, the interplay between MTs and G-protein during ABA-induced stomatal movement was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana. It was found that the heterotrimeric G-protein \u03b1 subunit mutant, gpa1, had a significantly higher water loss ratio than the wild type under the same conditions. Stomatal bioassay analyses revealed that guard cell sensitivity to ABA was attenuated in gpa1, and the mutant's ABA-insensitive phenotype could be partially restored by Oryzalin, an MT-specific inhibitor. However, exogenously applied Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM together with Oryzalin impaired the inhibition of stomatal opening by ABA. These results suggest that both MTs dynamics and Ca2+ flux may participate in the process of G-protein-mediated regulation of ABA-induced stomatal movement. Confocal microscopic images showed that after ABA treatment, MTs arrays in wild type underwent rapid disruption from radial arrays to disassembled fragments, whereas those in gpa1 largely remained bundled. A similar behavior was observed in BAPTA-AM plus ABA treatment, which is consistent with the stomatal bioassay results. In other words, G protein can control MTs rearrangement by adjusting the Ca2+ level in ABA-induced stomatal movement. In addition, non-invasive micro-test (NMT) demonstrated that the ABA-induced transmembrane Ca2+ flux was abolished in gpa1 guard cells, but Oryzalin enhanced the ABA response; Ca2+ efflux was suppressed dramatically when Oryzalin was added in gpa1. Therefore, our data clearly indicate that it exists a possitive crosstalking among G-protein, MTs and Ca2+ during ABA-induced stomatal movement. In this signal pathway, both MTs and Ca2+ act downstream of G-protein. Intracellular Ca2+ of guard cells relays signal information from G-protein to MTs; in turn, the changes of MTs dynamics in guard cells also have a feedback to Ca2+ flux. Finally the ABA signalling transduction results in stomatal movement, as well as the regulation of transpirational water loss and drought resistance. \u00a9 2017, Science Press. All right reserved."

In this study, a comprehensive study of four innovative SM-based indices, the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI), the Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI), the Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) and the Soil Wetness Deficit Index (SWetDI), is conducted over a large semi-arid crop region in northwest Spain. The indices were computed on a weekly basis from June 2010 to December 2016 using 1-km satellite SM estimations from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and/or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The temporal dynamics of the indices were compared to two well-known agricultural drought indices, the atmospheric water deficit (AWD) and the crop moisture index (CMI), to analyze the levels of similarity, correlation, seasonality and number of weeks with drought. In addition, the spatial distribution and intensities of the indices were assessed under dry and wet SM conditions at the beginning of the growing season. The results showed that the SWDI and SMADI were the appropriate indices for developing an efficient drought monitoring system, with higher significant correlation coefficients (R \u2248 0.5-0.8) when comparing with the AWD and CMI, whereas lower values (R \u2264 0.3) were obtained for the SMDI and SWetDI. \u00a9 2017 by the authors."

Therefore, it can be expected that rice endophytic bradyrhizobia can be applied in the rice-legume crop rotation system. Some endophytic bradyrhizobial strains were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) tissues. The rice biomass could be enhanced when supplementing bradyrhizobial strain inoculation with KNO3, NH4NO3, or urea, especially in Bradyrhizobium sp. strain SUTN9-2. In contrast, the strains which suppressed rice growth were photosynthetic bradyrhizobia and were found to produce nitric oxide (NO) in the rice root. The expression of genes involved in NO production was conducted using a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) technique. The nirK gene expression level in Bradyrhizobium sp. strain SUT-PR48 with nitrate was higher than that of the norB gene. In contrast, the inoculation of SUTN9-2 resulted in a lower expression of the nirK gene than that of the norB gene. These results suggest that SUT-PR48 may accumulate NO more than SUTN9-2 does. Furthermore, the nifH expression of SUTN9-2 was induced in treatment without nitrogen supplementation in an endophytic association with rice. The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase produced in planta by SUTN9-2 were also detected. Enumeration of rice endophytic bradyrhizobia from rice tissues revealed that SUTN9-2 persisted in rice tissues until rice-harvesting season. The mung bean (Vigna radiata) can be nodulated after rice stubbles were decomposed. Therefore, it is possible that rice stubbles can be used as an inoculum in the rice-legume crop rotation system under both low- and high-organic-matter soil conditions. \u00a9 2017 American Society for Microbiology."

This study investigated the stem radius variation of Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr growing in the semi-humid LiupanMountains of Northwest China at daily and seasonal scales using high-resolution automatic band dendrometers fromMay to October in 2015. The results showed that the stem radius variation of Larix principis-rupprechtii has a clear diurnal pattern which can be divided into contraction, recovery, and increment phases; and also a seasonal pattern which can be divided into three stages: (1) the rapid growth stage in spring (stage 1) with the radius increment of 94.0% of the total in the entire growing period; (2) the persistent shrinkage stage in the dry summer (stage 2) with a negative diurnal radius increment for most days, and a significantly larger amplitude of stem contraction and recovery than other stages; (3) the minimal growth stage in autumn (stage 3), mainly caused by the lowering temperature and leaf area. The amplitude of stem contraction was significantly correlated with air temperature (both the mean and highest value) in all three stages: vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in stage 1; relative humidity (RH), VPD and soil moisture (Ms) in stage 2; and soil temperature (Ts) in stage 3. This indicates that the stem radius contraction was mainly controlled by the factors influencing tree transpiration rate in spring and autumn stages, but jointly controlled by the factors influencing both the tree transpiration rate and the soil moisture availability in the dry summer stage. The factors controlling the stem radius recovery was similar to the stem contraction. The amplitude of stem increment was significantly correlated with the rainfall amount and air temperature (both the mean and highest value) in stage 1 and 3, Ms in stage 2, and the lowest air temperature and Ts in stage 3. This indicates that temperature and precipitation were the key factors controlling the stem radius increment in the spring and autumn stages, and soil moisture was the main factor limiting the stem radius increment in the dry summer stage at the study site with semi-humid climate in Northwest China. \u00a9 2017 by the authors."

The anthocyanin was extracted from a round sweet variety of blueberry and subjected to the highest co-pigment concentration (960 mg/l) at different pH values. The results showed that caffeic acid produced the highest stability of anthocyanin compared to the other co-pigments. In addition, benzoic acid had the lowest hyperchromic and bathochromic changes. A positive correlation was found between the co-pigment concentrations and the stability of anthocyanin as well as hyperchromic and bathochromic changes. The results also demonstrated that higher pH values resulted in further destruction of anthocyanin. Furthermore, the absorption rate of anthocyanin in the anthocyanin\u2013co-pigment complex within lower pH values was more compared with the higher ones. The strongest hyperchromic and bathochromic effects for all organic acids were observed in pH values 1 and 4, respectively. It can be concluded that among the tested co-pigments, caffeic acid was the best co-pigment, while benzoic acid was the weakest, which was not suitable for anthocyanin in the round sweet variety of blueberry. \u00a9 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Five specialized subgroups (TIP1-5) of TIPs have been found in higher plants, in which the TIP1 and TIP2 isoforms are the largest arbitrary groups. TIPs have high water-transport activity than PIPs, some TIPs can transport other small molecule such as urea, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and carbon dioxide. In this work, the structure of the putative tonoplast aquaporin from Gardenia jasminoides (GjTIP) was analyzed. Its transcript level has increased during fruit maturation. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that the protein belongs to TIP1 subfamily. A three-dimensional model structure of GjTIP was built based on crystal structure of an ammonia-permeable AtTIP2-1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. The model structure displayed as a homo-tetramer, each monomer has six trans-membrane and two half-membrane-spanning \u03b1 helices. The data suggests that the GjTIP has tendency to be a mixed function aquaporin, might involve in water, urea and hydrogen peroxide transport, and the gating machanism founded in some AQPs involving pH and phosphorylation response have not been proved in GjTIP. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

            "text": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a homeostatic cellular response conserved in eukaryotic cells to alleviate the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Arabidopsis bZIP28 is a membrane-bound transcription factor activated by proteolytic cleavage in response to ER stress, thereby releasing its cytosolic portion containing the bZIP domain from the membrane to translocate into the nucleus where it induces the transcription of genes encoding ER-resident molecular chaperones and folding enzymes. It has been widely recognized that the proteolytic activation of bZIP28 is mediated by the sequential cleavage of site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P). In the present study we provide evidence that bZIP28 protein is cleaved by S2P, but not by S1P. We demonstrated that wild-type and s1p mutant plants produce the active, nuclear form of bZIP28 in response to the ER stress inducer tunicamycin. In contrast, tunicamycin-treated s2p mutants do not accumulate the active, nuclear form of bZIP28. Consistent with these observations, s2p mutants, but not s1p mutants, exhibited a defective transcriptional response of ER stress-responsive genes and significantly higher sensitivity to tunicamycin. Interestingly, s2p mutants accumulate two membrane-bound bZIP28 fragments with a shorter ER lumen-facing C-terminal domain. Importantly, the predicted cleavage sites are located far from the canonical S1P recognition motif previously described. We propose that ER stress-induced proteolytic activation of bZIP28 is mediated by the sequential actions of as-yet-unidentified protease(s) and S2P, and does not require S1P. \u00a9 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Significant differences of contents of soluble solids, total sugars, inverted sugars, sucrose, total phenolic content, content of flavonoids and antioxidant activity were found among cultivar/treatment combinations, cultivars, treatments and years. Differences in total acids content among treatments and years were not statistically significant, but significant differences among cultivars and cultivar/treatment combinations were found. The contents of soluble solids, total sugars and sucrose were the highest in fruits of cultivar Jonagold Decosta, while the highest contents of inverted sugars, total acids, total phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant activity were found in fruits of Red Idared cultivar. The fertilization treatment T2 significantly influenced the content of soluble solids, total sugars, inverted sugars, total acids, total phenolic, flavonoids and antioxidant activity in the apple fruits. According to the results obtained, we can say that fertilization treatment T3 do not have much effect on bioactive ingredients, with the exception of the sucrose content. Among mineral elements, four were macroelements that were represented present in large amounts: potassium (K) (1266.15 mg kg\u20131 to 1652.89 mg kg\u20131), calcium (Ca) (122.76\u2012474.90 mg kg\u20131), phosphor (P) (86.14\u2012124.84 mg kg\u20131) and magnesium (Mg) (57.36\u201270.68 mg kg\u20131). On the other hand, four microelements were determined: boron (B) (1.06\u201214.25 mg kg\u20131); iron (Fe) (2.79\u20124.62 mg kg\u20131); manganese (Mn) (0.27\u20120.46 mg kg\u20131) and zinc (Zn) (0.15\u20120.48 mg kg\u20131). Results showed that contents of macroelements and microelements have been strongly affected by cultivar/treatment combinations, cultivars, treatments and years. \u00a9 T\u00dcB\u0130TAK."

We demonstrate that the nature of the isomer has a major impact on device performance, despite minor differences in optoelectronic and morphological properties, with the use of ortho-carborane resulting in the highest device efficiencies.

This study was the first to evaluate the genetic performance of these SE clones in different sites. In addition, the performance of SE clones and (zygotic) normal seedlings in the field was compared in this study. This study was based on three key groups of traits for Christmas tree production, measured 5 and 6 years after planting: growth, commercial tree quality, and disorder. Seedlings grew faster and had better Christmas tree quality than SE clones. There were significant family effects for all traits, indicating that a good family also produced good clones on average. Growth and disorder traits were under moderate genetic control, with estimated broad-sense heritability (H2) from 0.19 to 0.31 and from 0.20 to 0.28, respectively. Quality traits had low to moderate H2, ranging from 0.09 to 0.24. Significant genotype-by-environment interactions were shown for Christmas tree quality, post-harvest needle retention, and branch angle, suggesting the importance of choosing the right clone at each site. There was no significant interaction in height among the years. Superior clones, compared to the unbred seed source, were identified by combining several important traits. Overall, the somatic clones were well established but had slower growth compared to standard seedlings. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

Phytochemical composition was evaluated by preliminary phytochemical investigation, GCMS analysis, and total bioactive contents (TPC and TFC). The antioxidant, enzyme inhibition, antimicrobial, thrombolytic and anticancer activities were performed for biological evaluation. The extract exhibited the maximum total phenolic (49.24 \u00b1 1.21 mg GAE/g) and total flavonoid contents (29.9 \u00b1 1.13 mg QE/g) which may be correlated to higher antioxidant potential of extract. The GCMS investigation identified the presence of 27 phytocompounds of different classes related to aldehydes, esters of fatty acids, triterpenes, steroids, triterpenoid. The extract possessed the strong \u03b1-glucosidase (73.4 \u00b1 4.65 %) and moderate \u03b1-amylase inhibition activity (47.1 \u00b1 3.29 %). Significant results were observed in case of antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial activities. F. palmata extract inhibited the growth of HepG2 cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The extract also exhibited moderate in vitro thrombolytic activity. In addition, the phytocompounds identified by GCMS were subjected to in silico molecular docking studies to analyze the binding affinity between phytocompounds and enzymes (\u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase). Moreover, the best docked compounds were selected for ADMET studies which provide information about pharmacokinetics, physicochemical properties, drug-likeness, and toxicity of identified phytocompounds. The outcome of our research revealed that ethanolic extract of F. palmata possessed good antidiabetic, antimicrobial, thrombolytic and anticancer potential. This plant should be further explored to isolate the bioactive compounds for new drug development. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different concentrations of NPs-Se (0, 30, 50, 100, 150, and 250 mg\u00b7L-1) on the growth of alfalfa harvested multiple times, and to provide a basis for the production of Se-enriched forages. Applying 50 mg\u00b7L-1 concentration of NPs-Se had the best effect on yield over three harvests. Over three harvests, low-dose NPs-Se (30 and 50 mg\u00b7L-1) application significantly increased peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, chlorophyll content and carotenoid content, and significantly decreased malondialdehyde content. The total Se content and Se accumulation in plants at the same harvest showed an upward trend with increasing Se concentration. At the same concentration, from first harvest to third harvest, Se content and Se accumulation showed an initially increasing and then decreasing trend. The evaluation found that foliar application of NPs-Se at 50 mg\u00b7L-1 could have the greatest positive effect on the growth and yield of multiple-harvested alfalfa.  \u00a9 2023 the author(s)."

Field plot and lysimeter (intact soil column) trials were conducted in a free draining Horotiu silt loam soil to test whether two alternative forage species, plantain (Plantago lanceolate L.) and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), could reduce N2O emissions relative to traditional pasture species, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The amounts of N2O emitted from the soil below each forage species, which all received the same cow urine at the same rates, was measured using an established static chamber method. Total N2O emissions from the plantain, lucerne and perennial ryegrass controls (without urine application) were generally very low, but emissions from the white clover control were significantly higher. When urine was applied in autumn or winter N2O emissions from plantain were lower compared with those from perennial ryegrass or white clover, but this difference was not found when urine was applied in summer. Lucerne had lower emissions in winter but not in other seasons. Incorporation of plantain into grazed pasture could be an approach to reduce N2O emissions. However, further work is required to understand the mechanisms for the reduced emissions and the effects of environmental conditions in different seasons. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V."
