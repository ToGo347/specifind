            "text": "Background: Reducing contact between humans and black flies can lead to interruption of onchocerciasis transmission. The Esperanza Window Trap (EWT) has been shown to be an effective tool for reducing black fly densities. Several shape-based improvements to this trapping system have been made to optimise its effectiveness, but optimisation of this trapping system has been based most often on the shape of the trap, collection in areas of high black fly density and the addition of attractants, without considering transmission potentials and parity rates. This study aims to investigate the differences in biting rates and transmission potential between three catch points along a transect to guide the choice of EWT placement. Methods: Monthly black fly collection was carried out over a 1-year study period using the human landing method at three catch points along a transect from the riverside toward the centre of two first-line villages (Biatsota and Bayomen), in the Mbam valley in Cameroon. All female black flies caught were counted and dissected, and entomological indicators were computed and compared between the catch points and villages. Results: A total of 80,732 black flies were caught, of which 57,517 were dissected; of the latter, 2743 (4.8%) were parous and 44 (1.6%) were infective. Regarding the distance to the river, a vector density gradient was observed, with the highest annual biting rates being recorded at the riverside. The highest annual transmission potentials were also recorded at the riverside (165 vs 255 infective larvae/man/year in Bayomen and Biatsota, respectively). Overall, the highest parity rates were recorded at the riverside in Biatsota (5.1%) where various human activities are frequent and at the centre of Bayomen village (6.3%). Conclusion: The results of this study reveal that entomological parameters were the highest at the riverside catch sites and indicate that riverside locations should be prioritised for EWTs or other trapping systems to achieve optimal performance in onchocerciasis control.

It has been confirmed that DBTV is widely distributed in Shandong Province, China. However, its entomological and epidemiological features remain to be further explored, particularly the feasibility of transovarial transmission. Our research tries to explain the possibility of transovarial transmission of DBTV from engorged female ticks to their offspring. All engorged female adult ticks were sampled from domestic sheep and allowed to lay eggs and hatch in appropriate laboratory conditions. All engorged ticks, larvae and unhatched eggs were classified into pools for nucleic acid extraction and DBTV RNA detection. According to the results of qRT-PCR, the positive rate of DBTV was 6.25% (8/128) in engorged female ticks, 3.57% (1/28) in eggs and 5% (3/60) in larvae pools, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that DBTV isolates from larvae were similar to those from maternal ticks with more than 99.5% homology, and DBTV was relatively conservative in evolution. Our findings are the first to provide molecular evidence of potential transovarial transmission of DBTV among H. longicornis. Nonetheless, the transovarial transmission of DBTV in frequency and proportion occurring in nature deserves further investigation. Copyright: \u00a9 2023 Wang et al.

We review here the different defensive strategies employed by various holometabolan larvae found in Kachin amber, also reporting new cases of a leaf-mining hymenopteran caterpillar and a hangingfly caterpillar with extensive spines. This overview demonstrates that already 100 million years ago many modern strategies had already evolved in multiple lineages, but also reveals some cases of now extinct strategies. The repetitive independent evolution of similar strategies in distantly related lineages indicates that several strategies evolved convergently as a result of similar selective pressures. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

Across species, studies have shown that multisensory integration of visual and olfactory cues can improve response accuracy. However, in real-world settings, sensory cues are often noisy; visual and olfactory cues can be deteriorated, masked, or mixed, making the target cue less clear to the receiver. In this study, we use an associative learning paradigm (Free Moving Proboscis Extension Reflex, FMPER) to show that having multimodal cues may improve the accuracy of bees\u2019 responses to noisy cues. Adding a noisy visual cue improves the accuracy of response to a noisy olfactory cue, despite neither the clear nor noisy visual cue being sufficient when paired with a novel olfactory cue. This may provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying multimodal processing and the effects of environmental change on pollination services. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

            "text": "Background: In the Lake Victoria Basin of western Kenya, malaria remains highly endemic despite high coverage of interventions such as insecticide-impregnated long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN). The malaria-protective effect of LLINs is hampered by insecticide resistance in Anopheles vectors and its repurposing by the community. Ceiling nets and LLIN with synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO-LLIN) are novel tools that can overcome the problems of behavioral variation of net use and metabolic resistance to insecticide, respectively. The two have been shown to reduce malaria prevalence when used independently. Integration of these two tools (i.e., ceiling nets made with PBO-LLIN or Olyset\u00aePlus ceiling nets) appears promising in further reducing the malaria burden. Methods: A cluster-randomized controlled trial is designed to assess the effect of Olyset\u00aePlus ceiling nets on reducing malaria prevalence in children on Mfangano Island in Homa Bay County, where malaria transmission is moderate. Olyset\u00aePlus ceiling nets will be installed in 1315 residential structures. Malaria parasitological, entomological, and serological indicators will be measured for 12\u00a0months to compare the effectiveness of this new intervention against conventional LLIN in the control arm. Discussion: Wider adoption of Olyset\u00aePlus ceiling nets to complement existing interventions may benefit other malaria-endemic counties and be incorporated as part of Kenya\u2019s national malaria elimination strategy.

Scholars have demonstrated that nineteenth-century plantations were both ecologically vulnerable and reliant on exploited labour, with entomology deployed in their defence across the British Empire. Yet this paper argues that, despite its global reach, colonial entomology was sometimes conducted by individuals in pursuit of such parochial concerns as their local reputation and social standing. This case study examines the beetles of Ceylon through the eyes of Scottish plantation owner and amateur naturalist Robert Camperdown Haldane. His 1881 tract All About Grub erroneously identified the island's beetles as relatives of the European cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha). Although Haldane was a well-travelled individual who adopted a global science, he was also a product of Ceylon's plantation society: touchy about his social status and dismissive of his Indian labourers. The insular priorities of individuals or tight-knit communities could direct an enterprise with superficially global characteristics.  Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.

We have studied about 1350 endophytic egg traces of coenagrionid damselflies (Odonata: Zygoptera) from the Eocene, identifying triangular or drop-shaped scars associated with them. This study aims to determine the origin of these scars. Our behavioral study of about 1,800 endophytic eggs from recent coenagrionids indicates that these scars were caused by ovipositor incisions, but without egg insertion. The scar correlates (\u03c72-test) with leaf veins in both fossil and extant species. We infer that a female would detect the proximity of a leaf vein and avoid egg-laying, generating a scar that also fossilizes. For the first time, a scar produced by the ovipositor has been identified, indicating the existence of undesirable areas for oviposition. Accordingly, we recognize that Coenagrionidae damselflies (narrow-winged damselflies or pond damselflies) have been avoiding leaf veins for at least 52 million years. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

The insects were collected in cultivated areas of Fazenda Escola farm, at the State University of Londrina. A stock culture was established in the Entomology Laboratory (T: 25 \u00b1 1 \u00baC; 12-h photophase) and maintained on sunflower seeds and distilled water for the development of bioassays and experiment in a greenhouse. The insects were preliminarily subjected to the following treatments: water; a formulation with orange peel essential oil (1 mL L-1); a product based on Sophora flavescens (3 mL L-1); a formulation with orange peel essential oil (1 mL L-1) + S. flavescens (3 mL L-1); S. flavescens (3 mL L-1) + neutral detergent (1 mL L-1); silicone adjuvant (1 mL L-1); sucrose ester (1 mL L-1); and thiamethoxam (0.1 g L-1) as a positive control. Due to the efficiency of S. flavescens, with mortality greater than 90%, different concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mL L-1) were used on the adults. Higher doses of S. flavescens led to lower survival rates. After the dose of 4 mL L-1 was determined, another step was carried out in a greenhouse, using 18 pots with a capacity of 4 L of substrate containing plants of cultivar Albion surrounded by a voile fabric cage. Ten adult bugs were added to each pot; nine pots were sprayed with the S. flavescens-based product and the other nine only with distilled water. Sophora flavescens reduced the survival rate of N. bilobata in the laboratory and in the greenhouse. In conclusion, the S. flavescens-based product has the potential to control the bug N. bilobata at the tested rates, thus warranting further studies. \u00a9 2023 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

Disease incidence data suggest that these conditions occur disproportionately in the northwestern portion of the state, including in the county of Hunterdon. We conducted active surveillance at three forested sites in Hunterdon County during 2020 and 2021, collecting 662 nymphal and adult I. scapularis. Ticks were tested for five pathogens by qPCR/qRT-PCR: Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi, and Powassan virus (POWV) lineage 2. Over 2 years, 25.4% of nymphs and 58.4% of adults were found infected with at least one pathogen, with 10.6% of all ticks infected with more than one pathogen. We report substantial spatial and temporal variability of A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi, with high relative abundance of the human-infective A. phagocytophilum variant Ap-ha. Notably, POWV was detected for the first time in Hunterdon, a county where human cases have not been reported. Based on comparisons with active surveillance initiatives in nearby counties, further investigation of non-entomological factors potentially influencing rates of tick-borne illness in Hunterdon is recommended. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

Consequently, the ability to reliably estimate the post-mortem submersion interval for remains in water bodies is poor, despite markedly varying insect succession between aquatic and terrestrial decomposition This study was conducted to compare decomposition on Sus domesticus carcases in terrestrial and artificial lentic environments, aiming to provide more detailed characterization of aquatic decomposition and document the role of terrestrial organisms in the accompanying insect succession. Three trials consisting of six stillborn piglets in lentic environments and three in terrestrial environments were observed daily over a period of 12\u00a0months. Decomposition stage and morphological changes between terrestrial and lentic piglets were noted. Insects were sampled from remains and reared to adulthood for identification. Lentic decomposition was prolonged relative to terrestrial decomposition, reflecting aquatic decomposition characteristics accompanied by terrestrial insect colonization. Diptera were more prevalent on terrestrial remains, and Coleoptera in the lentic environments, with few dipteran taxa common between environments. Results show the variability of decomposition stages, characteristics and insects between terrestrial and lentic remains, and are discussed with regard to implications for aquatic forensic casework. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "The most widespread culture in the structure of fruit plantations in Ukraine is the apple tree. An important factor in the highly efficient production of apples is ensuring proper phytosanitary state of plantations and observing agrotechnological methods of growing, which is possible only with constant and long-term monitoring of the species composition, population dynamics, biological and ecological features of the entomoplex. The aim of the study conducted in 2005\u20132020 was to determine the ecological structure of the harmful entomocomplex of apple orchards under the conditions of the Central Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. Field, laboratory and chamber research methods generally accepted in ecology and entomology were used to fulfill the tasks. In the study, 52 species of phytophagous insects from 25 families and 7 orders were identified; 5 species of phytophagous mites from 3 families of Tetranychidae (Panonychus ulmi Koch., Tetranychus urticae Koch., Scizotetranychus pruni Oudms.), Bryobiidae (Bryobia redikorzevi Reck., syn: Bryobia praetiosa Koch.), Eriophyoidae (Eriophyes mali Nal.) were also found. The taxonomic structure of phytophagous insects was dominated by representatives of the orders of Lepidoptera (24 species), Coleoptera (14 species) and Homoptera (9 species), the portion of which collectively amounted to 90%. A range of Lepidoptera represented by 13 families was characterized by wide species diversity: Tortricidae, Gracillari\u0456dae, Yponomeutidae, Lyonetiidae, Cossidae, Sesiidae, Coleophoridae, Lasiocampidae, Geometridae, Pieridae, Arctiidae, Noctuidae, Orgyidae, which accounted for 46% of the harmful entomocomplex. The most numerous (dominant) species for the period 2005-2020 were three species of aphids (Aphis pomi De G, Dysaphis devecta Walk, Dysaphis mali Ferr.), apple moth (Carpocapsa pomonella L.) and leaf rollers (Archips rosana L.). In terms of trophic specialization, polyphages dominated 75% (39 species) of apple tree agrocenoses, 10% (5 species) of oligophagous insects, 15% (8 species) \u2013 monophages. The life forms were dominated by phytophiles \u2013 dendrobiotes, the percentage of which in the total structure of insect pests was about 90%. The species composition of harmful entomofauna and ecologically constant species of phytophagous insects in apple plantations in the Central Forest-Steppe of Ukraine were specified. A promising study is to clarify the features of the biology of the most harmful phytophagous insects under the conditions of climate change and to develop environmentally safe means of protecting apple plantations from pests. \u00a9 2023 The Authors."

            "text": "Background and Aim: One of the key components of the O ne Health approach to epidemic preparedness is raising awareness and increasing the knowledge of emerging infectious diseases, prevention, and risk reduction. However, related research can involve significant risks to biosafety and biosecurity. For this purpose, we organized a multidisciplinary biosafety hands-on workshop to inform and increase the knowledge of infectious diseases and risk mitigation. This study aimed to describe the process and outcome of a hands-on biosafety training program using a One Health a pproach across a multidisciplinary and multi-specialty group in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A face-to-face hands-on training for 48 participants was organized by the West African Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases (WAC-EID) at the Jos University Teaching Hospital, serving as a lead institution for the Nigeria project site. Topics covered included (1) an overview of the WAC-EID research; (2) overview of infection prevention and control; (3) safety in animal handling and restraint, sample collection, and processing; (4) safety in field studies including rodent, bird and bat handling; (5) safety practices in the collection of mosquito and other arthropod vectors; (6) personal protective equipment training (disinfection, donning and doffing); and (7) safety in sample collection, labeling, and transportation. The program was executed using a mixed method of slide presentations, practical hands-on sessions, and video demonstrations. Pre and post-course evaluation assessments and evaluation measures were used to assess training. Results: A total of 48 trainees participated in this training, with 12 (25%), 16 (33.3%), 14 (29.2%), 6 (12.5%) categorized as ornithology, entomology, mammalogy, and clinical interest groups, respectively. The pass rate for the pre-test was 29.4%, while for the post-test, it was 57.1%, or a 28% improvement. 88.6% of the trainees rated the training as relevant to them. Conclusion: Didactic and hands-on biosafety training is relevant in this era of zoonotic epidemics and pandemic preparedness. During this training program, there was a clear demonstration of knowledge transfer that can change the current practices of participants and improve the safety of infectious diseases research. \u00a9 Davwar, et al.

However, existing methods are laborious and produce data with low temporal resolution (e.g. trapping and direct observation), or are expensive, technically complex, and require vehicle access to field sites (e.g. radar and lidar entomology). We propose a method called \u201cCamfi\u201d for long-term non-invasive population monitoring and high-throughput behavioural observation of low-flying insects using images and videos obtained from wildlife cameras, which are inexpensive and simple to operate. To facilitate very large monitoring programs, we have developed and implemented a tool for automatic detection and annotation of flying insect targets in still images or video clips based on the popular Mask R-CNN framework. This tool can be trained to detect and annotate insects in a few hours, taking advantage of transfer learning. Our method will prove invaluable for ongoing efforts to understand the behaviour and ecology of declining insect populations and could also be applied to agronomy. The method is particularly suited to studies of low-flying insects in remote areas, and is suitable for very large-scale monitoring programs, or programs with relatively low budgets.

Operational cloud radars have been deployed around the world by meteorological agencies to study precipitation physics, and as a byproduct, provide a rich database of insect observations that is freely available to researchers. Although considered unwanted \u2018clutter\u2019 by the meteorologists who collect the data, the analysis method presented here enables ecologists to delineate co-occurring signals from insects and raindrops. We present a method that uses image processing techniques on cloud radar velocity spectra to examine the fate of migrating insects when they encounter precipitation. By analysing velocity spectra, we can distinguish flying insects from falling rain and compare the relative density of insects in flight before, during and after the rainfall. We demonstrate the method on a case of insect migration in Oklahoma, USA. Using this method, we show the first reconstructed images of migrating insect layers in flight during rainfall. Our analysis shows that mild to moderate rainfall diminishes the number of insects aloft but does not cause full termination of migratory flight, as has previously been suggested. We hope this technique will spur further investigations of how changing weather conditions impact insect migration, and enable some of the first of such studies in regions of the world that are underrepresented in the literature. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

            "text": "Background Despite the use of numerous methods of control measures, mosquito populations and mos-quito-borne diseases are still increasing globally. Evidence-based action thresholds to initi-ate or intensify control activities have been identified as essential in reducing mosquito populations to required levels at the correct/optimal time. This systematic review was conducted to identify different mosquito control action thresholds existing across the world and associated surveillance and implementation characteristics. Methodology/Principal findings Searches for literature published from 2010 up to 2021 were performed using two search engines, Google Scholar and PubMed Central, according to PRISMA guidelines. A set of inclusion/exclusion criteria were identified and of the 1,485 initial selections, only 87 were included in the final review. Thirty inclusions reported originally generated thresholds. Thirteen inclusions were with statistical models that seemed intended to be continuously utilized to test the exceedance of thresholds in a specific region. There was another set of 44 inclusions that solely mentioned previously generated thresholds. The inclusions with \u201cepidemio-logical thresholds\u201d outnumbered those with \u201centomological thresholds\u201d. Most of the inclusions came from Asia and those thresholds were targeted toward Aedes and dengue control. Overall, mosquito counts (adult and larval) and climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) were the most used parameters in thresholds. The associated surveillance and implementation characteristics of the identified thresholds are discussed here. Conclusions/Significance The review identified 87 publications with different mosquito control thresholds developed across the world and published during the last decade. Associated surveillance and implementation characteristics will help organize surveillance systems targeting the development and implementation of action thresholds, as well as direct awareness towards already existing thresholds for those with programs lacking available resources for comprehensive surveillance systems. The findings of the review highlight data gaps and areas of focus to fill in the action threshold compartment of the IVM toolbox. \u00a9 2023, Public Library of Science. All rights reserved."

Spatial heterogeneity together with seasonal changes in abundance constitute important elements for the understanding of the dynamics of vector populations, and there are fundamental for the development of adequate prevention and control strategies. The aim of this work was to compare the spatial and seasonal abundance of Lu. longipalpis and Ny. whitmani at a city spatial scale between two periods separated by three years. To study the spatial distribution, we compared the abundance distribution of these species at two warm times, 2011 with 2014. Respect to inter-annual seasonal abundance changes, we compared the four seasons of the year between two periods (2011\u20132012 vs 2014\u20132016). The spatial distribution for both species were found to be distributed mainly in the same areas of the city in both periods. We change for: Respect to the seasonal pattern of abundance, we observed that seasonal patterns showed changes between periods.

The aim of this study was to investigate the sand fly fauna, mainly the species composition, biodiversity, and seasonal activity of sand flies in El Hajeb in central Morocco. A total of six stations (A\u00eft Naaman, A\u00eft Rbaa, A\u00eft Brahim, Ain Taoujdate, Sidi Mbarek, and A\u00eft Oufella) were studied, five of which had recently recorded cases of leishmaniasis. Sand fly bimonthly captures were carried out using a sticky paper trap in different biotopes from March to December 2019. A total of 14590 adult sand flies were collected. The activity of the sand fly started in April and declined in November. The periods of high abundance were July, September, and November. Morphological identification of sand flies shows the presence of twelve species: Phlebotomus papatasi, P. longicuspis, P. perniciosus, P. sergenti, P. bergeroti, P. alexandri, P. dreyfussi, P. ariasi, Sergentomyia fallax, S. minuta, S. schwetzi, and S. antennata. The analysis showed that species belonging to the genus Phlebotomus were the most dominant (93.3%) and the risk periods were spread during the summer and autumn seasons. The present study provides for the first time information on the species of sand flies in El Hajeb. It, therefore, provides decision makers with an important tool to conduct vector control actions during peak periods in order to limit the transmission of leishmaniasis.

            "text": "Background: The vector species in the Amazon River Basin are regionally and locally diverse, which makes it imperative to understand and compare their roles in malaria transmission to help select appropriate methods of intervention and evaluation. The major aim of this study was to measure the vectorial capacity of five Anopheles species in three neighbouring villages, for two Plasmodium parasite species affecting humans. Methods: From 32 consecutive months of sampling in three villages, 1.5\u20137.0\u00a0km apart, on the Matapi River, Amap\u00e1 State, Brazil, vectorial capacities (C) were estimated as time series for An. darlingi, An. marajoara, An. nuneztovari, An. triannulatus, and An. intermedius. Monthly parity measurements for each vector species were used to estimate daily survivorship and compared to estimates of survivorship from mark-release-recapture experiments. Gonotrophic cycle lengths were estimated through a time-series analysis of parity data, and durations of sporogony at study site temperatures for the two malaria parasite species were estimated from previous literature. Results: The absolute abundances of five vector species were strongly tracked by the spatial variation in C among villages. Temporally, C varied between wet and dry seasons, with An. darlingi, An. marajoara and An. triannulatus exhibiting higher C in the dry season from August to December, and An. nuneztovari its highest C early in the rainy season in January and February. Anopheles intermedius exhibited higher C in the rainy season from April to June than in the dry season. Significant differences in overall survival for each independent variable, and a significant difference in C between wet and dry seasons, among villages, and among vector species for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis by village showed significant effects of vector species on C in only one village, but significant effects of parasite species in all three. Although the GLMM analysis detected no significant parasite x vector species interaction effects on C, effects on C of spline regressions of C dynamics x vector species interactions were significant in all villages. Conclusions: These detailed analyses of entomological and parasitological variables revealed hidden complexities of malaria epidemiology at local scales in neighbouring riverine villages of the Amazon Region. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s)."

The burden of malaria and the impact of control measures were assessed in longitudinal cohorts, cross-sectional surveys, passive and reactive case detection, and other observational designs that incorporated multidisciplinary scientific approaches: classical epidemiology, geospatial science, serosurveillance, parasite and mosquito genetics, and vector bionomics. Findings to date have helped elaborate the patterns and possible causes of sustained low-to-moderate transmission in southern Zambia and eastern Zimbabwe and recalcitrant high transmission and fatality in northern Zambia. Cryptic and novel mosquito vectors, asymptomatic parasite reservoirs in older children, residual parasitemia and gametocytemia after treatment, indoor residual spraying timed dyssynchronously to vector abundance, and stockouts of essential malaria commodities, all in the context of intractable rural poverty, appear to explain the persistent malaria burden despite current interventions. Ongoing studies of high-resolution transmission chains, parasite population structures, long-term malaria periodicity, and molecular entomology are further helping to lay new avenues for malaria control in southern and central Africa and similar settings.  \u00a9 2022 The author(s)."

            "text": "Introduction With its proven effectiveness, indoor residual spraying (IRS) as a malaria vector control strategy forms one of the reliable vector control strategies, especially when at least 80% of the population is covered. However, to date, there is uncertainty regarding the consequences of IRS withdrawal on malaria control when there is no clear exit strategy in place. Therefore, there is a need to comprehensively update literature regarding malaria burden indicators when IRS is withdrawn following sustained use. Methods and analysis This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A systematic search of studies published between 2000 and 2022 will be performed in CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsychInfo, Scopus and OpenGrey. Preset eligibility criteria will be used to identify studies for inclusion by two independent reviewers. Title/abstracts will first be screened and potentially eligible ones screened using their full-text publications. Any conflicts/discrepancies at the two stages will be resolved through regular discussion sessions. Included studies will be extracted to capture study and patient characteristics and relevant outcomes (malaria incidence and malaria vector abundance). Relevant tools will be used to assess the risk of bias in the studies measuring the impact of withdrawal. A meta-analysis will be performed if sufficient homogeneity exists; otherwise, data arising will be presented using tables and by employing narrative synthesis techniques. Heterogeneity will be assessed using a combination of visual inspection of the forest plot along with consideration of the \u03c7 2 test and I 2 statistic results. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not applicable for this study since no original data will be collected. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Furthermore, this systematic review will inform the design of exit strategies for IRS-based programmes in malaria-endemic areas.

Surveillance of mosquitoes and the mosquito-borne pathogen is a vital approach for early warning, prevention, and control of the infectious disease. In this study, from 2018 to 2020, a total of 141607 female mosquitoes were caught by means of the light trap method. The main species were Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus/pallens (41.32%), Culex tritaeniorhynchus (47.6%), Aedes albopictus (2.5%), Anopheles sinensis (5.87%), Armigeres subalbatus (2.64%) and other mosquito species (0.07%). Cx. pipiens s.l. were the dominant species in two urban habitats and rural residential areas while Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was the main dominant species in the rural livestock sheds. In terms of seasonal fluctuation, Cx. pipiens s.l fluctuated at a high level from May to October. The peaks of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, An. sinensis and Ar. subalbatus were in July. In addition, a total of 693 Ae. albopictus were collected with Biogents Mosquitaire CO2 traps in emergency surveillance of dengue fever (DF) and screened for dengue virus infection. There were three circumstances of collection: The first: the sampling time before mosquito control during the local outbreak of DF in Lucheng of Wenzhou, 2019; The second circumstance: the sampling time after mosquito control during the local outbreak of DF of other cities in 2018-2019; The third circumstance: past DF epidemic areas the sampling time before mosquito control during the local outbreak of DF in Lucheng, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 2019. The pools formed by mosquitoes collected in these three circumstances were 3 (6.1%), 35 (71.5%), and 11 (22.4%) respectively. Of the 49 pools tested, only one in the first circumstance was positive. The full-length dengue virus sequence of ZJWZ/2019 was obtained by sequencing and uploaded to the NCBI as number OK448162. Full-length nucleotide and amino acid homology analyses showed that ZJWZ2019 and Wenzhou DF serum isolates ZJWZ-62/2019 (MW582816) and ZJWZ-18/2019 (MW582815) had the highest homology. The analysis of full genome and E gene phylogenetic trees showed that ZJWZ2019 belonged to serotype 1, genotype I, lineage II, which was evolutionarily related to OK159963/Cambodia/2019. It implies that ZJWZ2019 originated in Cambodia. This study showed the species composition, seasonal dynamics of mosquitoes in different habitats in Zhejiang province and confirmed the role of Ae. albopictus in the transmission cycle of in outbreak of DF in the Lucheng district of Wenzhou in 2019, suggesting the importance of monitoring of vector Aedes infected dengue virus in the prevention and control of DF.

To overcome this challenge, the objective of this study is to propose the use of emerging digital media, namely three-dimensional printing (3DP) technologies, to create reusable, fake, \u201clive\u201d insects. In this study, we designed two 3D-printed pedagogical aids to support elementary entomology. The first aid was a set of cards showing photos of the 3D-printed insect prototype, which could help the learners in close observation of the insect body\u2019s regions and parts, and the second 3D-printed aid was a construction kit mimicking physical insects, which were made of an enlarged 3D-printed insect prototype. The two aids were used in our field experiment to examine the effectiveness in learning and motivation. A total of 153 pupils were grouped into three groups (one using the existing multimedia e-book, one using the first 3DP aid, and one using the second aid). The results confirm that the digital media application\u2014in this case, 3DP technologies\u2014were able to compensate for the lack of the live insects. These results raised our confidence in using a customized size 3D-printed insect prototype to enhance rudimentary entomology inside the classroom. If the 3DP technologies are used properly, they could offer an innovative and sustainable solution. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

After six to seven molts, the larvae stop feeding and dig pupation chambers to hide and safely evolve into adults. Such pupation chambers have already been observed on archaeological mammals\u2019 bones, but the attribution and interpretation of these osteological lesions lack experimental evidence in a forensic context. To observe whether dermestid larvae dig pupation chambers in human bones, 20 or 40 Dermestes maculatus (De Geer, 1774) larvae were placed in a dermestarium with different types of bones varying in species (Bos taurus or human), age (adult or immature), and preservation method (fresh or dry). Our results show that dermestid larvae caused multiple lesions, including larval mandible traces on cortical bone, cortical perforations, drilling of pupation chambers, destruction of the trabecular network, and the perforation of cartilage. Bone destruction was mainly observed on aged dry bones, while fresh bones only exhibited soft tissue and superficial cartilage lesions. According to these results, pupation chambers could indicate the simultaneous presence of several corpses at different decomposition stages, or the addition of new corpses while others were already skeletonized. These conclusions are particularly important in the case of mass graves, where chronology is sometimes difficult to establish. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

Onchocerciasis and loiasis are coendemic in forest areas of Central Africa where ivermectin treatment can lead to severe adverse events in individuals with heavy loiasis load, rendering MDA inappropriate. Vector control has been proposed as a complementary intervention strategy. Here, we discuss (i) achievements and pitfalls of previous interventions; (ii) epidemiological impact, feasibility, and combination with MDA to accelerate and/or protect EoT; (iii) role of modelling; (iv) opportunities for innovative methods of vector monitoring and control; and (v) strengthening entomological capacity in endemic countries. \u00a9 2022 The Authors"

Nevertheless, identification using taxonomy keys may be hampered, if the morphological characteristics of the larvae are incomplete, or immature for microscopic identification. To overcome the difficulty of species determination, molecular identification has gained relevance and is applied in forensic investigations. This study aimed to identify a novel target gene, known as the gustatory receptor 1 gene (CmegGr1), which has never been used for identification. The third instar larvae of Ch. megacephala (n = 30) and eight other forensically important fly species were obtained from two sources; rabbit carcasses and the Forensic Entomology Unit collection. Their DNAs were extracted and the CmegGr1 gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resulting sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. A 209 bp fragment of the CmegGr1 gene was successfully amplified in 80% (24/30) of Ch. megacephala samples, while all of the non-Ch. megacephala species were not amplified. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the evolutionary tree of CmegGr1 shares many traits with the 21a gustatory receptors of Calliphora stygia and Lucilia cuprina (Gr21a), which are also classified as necrophagous fly species. The high specificity of species identification was demonstrated in the present study using DNA barcoding, which led to the conclusion that the CmegGr1 gene could serve as an alternative marker for identifying Ch. megacephala. \u00a9 2022, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

In a health impact assessment study of the irrigation canals from December 2010 to February 2016, the breeding of two major malaria vectors. An. culicifacies and An. stephensi were observed in diggies and sumpwells. As a biological control, Gambusia affanis fishes were employed for larval control in such stagnated water sites during the intervention phase viz. February 2012 in 251 diggies and 251 sumpwells. A significant reduction of breeding in diggies (99.54%) and sumpwells (97.81%) was observed. The positivity and larval density (dip index) were monitored in the control from up to February 2016 for their sustainability. \u00a9 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved."

Previous studies have shown Drosophila resource use has a strong genetic basis, although there is evidence that preferences are adaptable given isolation from ancestral hosts. Given the high degree of adaptability and behavioral plasticity of invasive species, we were interested in the mechanisms affecting host preferences of the invasive fruit fly, Drosophila suzukii, which in recent years has developed a nearly global range infesting small fruit crops. We studied the diet hierarchies of D. suzukii using a combination of laboratory and field assays designed to assess how female oviposition host choice differs given the availability of, and experience with, different fruit and non-fruit hosts. We found that host preferences did not shift over time and flies reared on two differential isolated diets up to F5 behaved and performed similarly regardless of diet lineage. Rather, female host choice appeared guided by a fixed hierarchical system of host preferences. Raspberry was more preferred to mushroom, which was more preferred to goose manure. However, if preferred resources were absent, the use of less-preferred resources was compensatory. We suggest that among niche specialists, such as D. suzukii, these hierarchies may support a bet-hedging strategy, rather than multiple-niche polymorphism, allowing for niche separation during periods of increased competition, while maintaining more diverse, ancestral feeding behaviors when preferred resources are scarce.

The 2018 sample consisted of 1 worker ant, and the 2019 sample consisted of 3 worker ants. Thoraces were used for genetic assessment and gasters were used for venom analyses. It was determined readily from genetic and chemical analyses that the intercepted ants were not S. invicta or S. richteri. Mitochondrial COX1 gene sequences were compared with previously published data from Solenopsis species. The closest match for the 2018 sample was S. xyloni, which is native to the shipment's origin (San Diego, California, USA). The 2 major alkaloids found were characteristic of the S. geminata species group. In addition, the alkaloid ratio closely matched that of S. xyloni. Therefore, the alkaloid analysis of the 2018 intercepted ant concurs with the genetic data that the ant was an S. xyloni worker. The COX1 gene sequences of the 2019 interceptions most closely matched S. geminata. The corresponding venom alkaloid profile also eliminated S. invicta and S. richteri as possibilities. However, 1 major alkaloid was unusual (Fig. 2) and normally is found only in trace amounts. We suggest the 2019 specimens are an unusual variant of S. geminata. \u00a9 2022 Florida Entomological Society. All rights reserved."

Here we investigate genomic variation in 3 natural North American populations of an agricultural pest and a model insect for many scientific disciplines, the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta). We show that hornworms from Arizona, Kansas, and North Carolina are genetically distinct, with Arizona being particularly differentiated from the other 2 populations using Illumina whole-genome resequencing. Peaks of differentiation exist across the genome, but here, we focus in on the most striking regions. In particular, we identify 2 likely segregating inversions found in the Arizona population. One inversion on the Z chromosome may enhance adaptive evolution of the sex chromosome. The larger, 8 Mb inversion on chromosome 12 contains a pseudogene which may be involved in the exploitation of a novel hostplant in Arizona, but functional genetic assays will be required to support this hypothesis. Nevertheless, our results reveal undiscovered natural variation and provide useful genomic data for both pest management and evolutionary genetics of this insect species. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The aphidophagous coccinellids are efficient in controlling the pestiferous population of aphids. The two coccinellid Coccinella septempunctata and Cheilomenes sexmaculata are efficient in predation of cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora in southern Rajasthan. The present study determined the response of prey consumption at different prey densities. Methods: To compute the functional and numeric response of the lady bird beetle on cowpea aphid, experiment was conducted in vitro by using cowpea potted plant in caged conditions at Department of Entomology, Rajasthan College of Agriculture during 2019-20. The cowpea pea plants were sown in small pots and were placed in aluminium insect cages having 15 cm \u2613 15 cm \u2613 15 cm size. The predatory potential of coccinellid grubs and adults were evaluated at six different prey densities (aphids per arena): 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 and 200 with 5 replications. Result: The grub and adults of C. septempunctata consumed more prey as compared to C. sexmaculata. Both the coccinellid showed Type II functional response when functional curve was plotted. The linear regression method suggested that C. septempunctata required less time to act upon prey as compared to C. sexmaculata. The C. septempunctata also showed more numeric response in terms of ECI [conversion efficiency of prey consumption (ECI) into biomass (egg)] at different prey densities. The fecundity in both the cases increased with the increased prey densities that eventually decreased after reaching the maximum egg laying capacity at prey density of 125 aphids. In all the cases it was found that consumption rate of predaceous beetle increased with increasing aphid population. \u00a9 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved."

Methods: Following the reporting of the index case of autochthonous dengue, epidemiological investigation, vector control and substances of human origin safety measures were immediately activated, according to the national arbovirus surveillance plan. Dengue cases were followed-up with weekly visits and laboratory tests until recovery and clearance of viral RNA from blood. Results: The primary dengue case was identified in a young woman, who developed fever after returning from Indonesia to northern Italy, on 27 July 2020. She spent the mandatory quarantine for COVID-19 at home with relatives, six of whom developed dengue within two weeks. Epidemiological investigation identified further five autochthonous dengue cases among people who lived or stayed near the residence of the primary case. The last case of the outbreak developed fever on 29 September 2020. Dengue cases had a mild febrile illness, except one with persistent asthenia and myalgia. DENV-1 RNA was detected in blood and/or urine in all autochthonous cases, up to 35 days after fever onset. All cases developed IgM and IgG antibodies which cross-reacted with West Nile virus (WNV) and other flaviviruses. Sequencing of the full viral genome from blood samples showed over 99% nucleotide identity with DENV-1 strains isolated in China in 2014-2015; phylogenetic analysis classified the virus within Genotype I. Entomological site inspection identified a high density of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which conceivably sustained local DENV-1 transmission. Aedes koreicus mosquitoes were also collected in the site. Conclusions: Areas in Europe with high density of Aedes mosquitoes should be considered at risk for dengue transmission. The presence of endemic flaviviruses, such as WNV, might pose problems in the laboratory diagnosis.  \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)."

It is imperative that forensic sciences have data from studies carried out in the field. Therefore, this work aims to: (1) evaluate the parameters (weight, length, development time) associated with the life cycles of Lucilia ochricornis (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and Lucilia purpurascens (Walker) under experimental conditions in the field considering fluctuating temperatures, and (2) compare these results with those known and published by the same authors for cultures realized in the laboratory under constant temperatures; which will permit us to contrast the most widely used existing methodologies for forensic application in estimating the minimum postmortem interval (PMImin). For each season of the year, cultures of both species were made in the field, collecting information on temperature, humidity, and photoperiod to perform laboratory cultures, later comparing: development time, length, weight, and Accumulated Degree-Hours (ADH) in both types of cultures. Methods for estimating the PMI were obtained and validated with the information of the cultures grown in the field. The two types of cultures showed differences between each other for both species. The forensic use methods to estimate PMI were enhanced and their precision increased when maximum larval length data were used, and it was also concluded that feeding larval stages are the most accurate to be used in making estimates because the larva is growing. The estimation of the PMI through the use of necrophagous flies development remains reliable for obtaining the PMImin.  \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

            "text": "Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is an emerging zoonosis caused by Leishmania infantum and transmitted in southern Europe by phlebotomine sand flies of the subgenus Phlebotomus (Larroussius). Endemic foci of CanL have been recorded in northern continental Italy since early 1990s and attributed to the northward expansion of vector populations due to climatic changes in association with travelling/relocated infected dogs from the southern Mediterranean littoral. In this study, further spread of endemic Leishmania foci was monitored during 2018\u20132019 in five regions (Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia), with focus to territories where investigations were not performed, or they have been inconclusive. Clinical cases of CanL identified by local veterinary practitioners and confirmed by reference diagnosis centers were regarded as autochthonous if their origin from, or travel to, areas endemic for CanL were excluded in the previous \u22652 years. Around these index cases, i) serosurveys for L infantum were carried out where indicated, ii) sampling from potential autochthonous cases in healthy or clinically-suspected resident dogs was intensified by collaborating veterinary practitioners, and iii) suitable sites were investigated for the presence of competent phlebotomine vectors. Fifty-seven municipalities whose enzootic status of CanL was unreported before 2018, were identified as endemic. The stability of 27 foci recorded over the past decade, was also confirmed. Competent phlebotomine vectors, mainly Phlebotomus perniciosus, were collected for the first time in 23 municipalities. The newly recorded endemic municipalities appear to be distributed over a west-to-east decreasing gradient: 30 in Piedmont, 21 in Lombardy, 4 in Veneto and 2 in Friuli-Venezia Giulia. As regards Veneto, it should be noted that a relatively restricted territory was investigated as several municipalities of the region had already been surveyed and detected as endemic for CanL in the past. Cold climate conditions of the easternmost region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia bordering non-endemic territories of Slovenia, are probably less favorable to L infantum transmission. \u00a9 2021"

The book also covers insect pollinators which play important role for fruits in horticultural crop production. Intensive and extensive cultivation of horticultural crops lead to serious pest problem. Climatic conditions in India and elsewhere due to which new pests have emerged that causes severe damage to the horticultural crops. In response to this, researchers have developed new techniques to fight pests and their growing resistance to pesticides. This book covers the latest information on identity, biology, damage, seasonal development, and pest management of the horticultural crop pests. It serves to be an essential tool for horticultural professionals, including development officers, horticulturists, field-level extension workers, nurserymen, planters, and entomologists, and is a valuable source of reference for relevant researchers, teachers, and students in the region. \u00a9 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022."

Cost-effective ecological monitoring of arthropods by traps has been gaining interest in the field of environmental entomology since last few decades. This study explains the effectiveness of four different types of traps (pitfall, yellow-sticky, pan and barrier traps) to monitor the arthropod diversity in summer and winter seasons. These traps were installed in different mango orchards located in Punjab, Pakistan. diversity of captured arthropods was 1.5 times higher in summer than in winter season. However, among the traps, pitfall traps were most effective than others for trapping edaphic arthropods in both seasons. The pan traps were found most effective in the summer season, while sticky traps in the winter season. The pitfall traps exhibited highest taxa richness index values (8.00 for summer and 5.00 for winter season), while the lowest values were recorded for barrier traps (5.00 for summer and 3.00 for winter season). Moreover, the pitfall were the most effective traps for the capture or collection of Arachnida, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera and other arthropods. The PVC barrier and sticky traps were found most effective for Dipteran and Hemipteran's insects, respectively, and hence, are recommended for the ecological monitoring of these arthropod groups in future studies. \u00a9 2021 The Authors"

Briefly, carrion flies ingest various chemicals as they feed on a cadaver. In entomotoxicology, such toxicological compounds are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in insects recovered from carrion. Some of these chemicals can disrupt flies' cellular physiology, leading to acceleration or delay in their developmental rate. In this study, the effect of zolpidem-contaminated tissue on the dipteran flies Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius 1794) and Chrysomya saffranea (Bigot 1877) was assessed. Zolpidem tartrate is a sedative-hypnotic compound commonly used to treat anxiety and sleeping disorders, but it is associated with death from suicide. The effects were tested by providing the flies with liver tissue treated with various concentrations of zolpidem tartrate. The morphological parameters and development rate for all life cycle stages of treated insects were determined and used to estimate postmortem intervals. Results showed that the morphological parameters, i.e., weight, width, and length and rate of development of C. megacephala and C. saffranea was negatively associated with zolpidem tartrate concentration of C. saffranea, were negatively associated with the concentration of zolpidem tartrate, indicating that arthropod evidence evaluation can help establish the cause and time of death. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021."

            "text": "Introduction: Longitudinal monitoring of outdoor-biting malaria vector populations is becoming increasingly important in understanding the dynamics of residual malaria transmission. However, the human landing catch (HLC), the gold standard for measuring human biting rates indoors and outdoors, is costly and raises ethical concerns related to increased risk of infectious bites among collectors. Consequently, routine data on outdoor-feeding mosquito populations are usually limited because of the lack of a scalable tool with similar sensitivity to outdoor HLC. Methodology: The Anopheles trapping sensitivity of four baited proxy outdoor trapping methods\u2014Furvela tent trap (FTT), host decoy trap (HDT), mosquito electrocuting traps (MET) and outdoor CDC light traps (OLT)\u2014was assessed relative to HLC in a 5 \u00d7 5 replicated Latin square conducted over 25 nights in two villages of western Kenya. Indoor CDC light trap (ILT) was run in one house in each of the compounds with outdoor traps, while additional non-Latin square indoor and outdoor HLC collections were performed in one of the study villages. Results: The MET, FTT, HDT and OLT sampled approximately 4.67, 7.58, 5.69 and 1.98 times more An. arabiensis compared to HLC, respectively, in Kakola Ombaka. Only FTT was more sensitive relative to HLC in sampling An. funestus in Kakola Ombaka (RR = 5.59, 95% CI 2.49\u201312.55, P < 0.001) and Masogo (RR = 4.38, 95% CI 1.62\u201311.80, P = 0.004) and in sampling An. arabiensis in Masogo (RR = 5.37, 95% CI 2.17\u201313.24, P < 0.001). OLT sampled significantly higher numbers of An. coustani in Kakola Ombaka (RR = 3.03, 95% CI 1.65\u20135.56, P < 0.001) and Masogo (RR = 2.88, 95% CI 1.15\u20137.22, P = 0.02) compared to HLC. OLT, HLC and MET sampled mostly An. coustani, FTT had similar proportions of An. funestus and An. arabiensis, while HDT sampled predominantly An. arabiensis in both villages. FTT showed close correlation with ILT in vector abundance for all three species at both collection sites. Conclusion: FTT and OLT are simple, easily scalable traps and are potential replacements for HLC in outdoor sampling of Anopheles mosquitoes. However, the FTT closely mirrored indoor CDC light trap in mosquito indices and therefore may be more of an indoor mimic than a true outdoor collection tool. HDT and MET show potential for sampling outdoor host-seeking mosquitoes. However, the traps as currently designed may not be feasible for large-scale, longitudinal entomological monitoring. Therefore, the baited outdoor CDC light trap may be the most appropriate tool currently available for assessment of outdoor-biting and malaria transmission risk.

This is especially problematic because most behaviors are not preserved by the physical specimens stored in typical natural history collections. Improving the reporting and archiving of insect behavior and natural history data holds the promise of allowing scientists to track real-time responses of animals to global change and will preserve aspects of natural history that might otherwise be lost due to extinctions. Here we argue that behavioral ecologists should work to preserve and archive raw media files and field notes related to behavior and natural history of their study organisms. One major mechanism to incentivize archiving of such data would be for journals to develop policies for archiving of natural history data that is the focus of the paper or ancillary information collected about study subjects. Buy in from researchers, journals, and funding agencies will be needed to make substantial changes in data archiving. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc."

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the type of infection of female Anopheles mosquitoes to sporozoites of Plasmodium species (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum), using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in southeastern Iran. Methods: To determine the infections and Plasmodium species using the nested PCR in Sistan and Baluchestan Province (southeast-ern Iran), 360 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from the control villages of Chabahar and Konarak counties and exam-ined by entomology check stations affiliated with Zahedan University of Medical Sciences in the second half of 2018. The mosquitos were caught manually from indoor places (humans and animals) as well as natural and artificial sites, i.e., pit-shelters. After DNA extraction, the molecular analysis was performed by nested PCR. Results: Of 200 species collected from Daregas, Owraki, and Bahu Kalat in Chabahar, four Anopheles stephensi (2%) were infected with P. vivax, and of 160 samples collected from the rural districts of Konarak, including Zarabad, Heyan, Islamabad, and Joholu, two An. stephensi (1.25%) were infected with P. falciparum. In this study, no mixed infection of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum were observed. Conclusions: The present study showed that the only species infected with Plasmodium in the aforementioned regions was An. stephensi, which was the most frequent species of Anopheles among other species as well. The nested PCR could be the most suitable method for detecting Plasmodium parasites in malaria vectors, among other diagnostic methods. \u00a9 2021, Author(s)."

Eight rat carcasses were buried in separate holes at depths of 20 and 40 cm (four holes per depth) to allow natural decomposition and examined at 10-day intervals up to 40 days. During the study period, environmental factors such as humidity, soil temperature, and air temperature were monitored at each depth on a daily basis. At the end of each burial period, one carcass from each depth was exhumed and the degree of decay and presence of insect activity were examined. The results showed that burial depth and temperature were major factors affecting the decomposition rate, whereas no insect activity was observed. The findings of this study can be used to more accurately estimate the time since burial of carcasses. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)"

We conducted a pilot to test the impact of housing improvement plus indoor residual spraying (IRS) on house infestation and vector abundance in a rural community in the Bolivian Chaco. Methods: The intervention included three arms: housing improvement + IRS [HI], assisted IRS [AS] in which the team helped to clear the house pre-IRS and routine IRS [RS]. HI used locally available materials, traditional construction techniques and community participation. Vector parameters were assessed by Timed Manual Capture for 2 person-hours per house at baseline and medians of 114, 173, 314, 389 and 445\u00a0days post-IRS-1. A second IRS round was applied at a median of 314\u00a0days post-IRS-1. Results: Post-intervention infestation indices and abundance fell in all three arms. The mean odds of infestation was 0.29 (95% CL 0.124, 0.684) in the HI relative to the RS arm. No difference was observed between AS and RS. Vector abundance was reduced by a mean 44% (24.8, 58.0) in HI compared to RS, with no difference between AS and RS. Median delivered insecticide concentrations per house were lower than the target of 50\u00a0mg/m2 in >90% of houses in all arms. Conclusion: Housing improvement using local materials and community participation is a promising strategy to improve IRS effectiveness in the Bolivian Chaco. A larger trial is needed to quantify the impact on reinfestation over time. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

It is championed for its potential to provide experiential learning opportunities to the public. Documentation of educational outcomes and benefits for citizen scientists continues to grow. This study proposes an added benefit of these collaborations: The transference of program impacts to individuals outside of the program. The experiences of fifteen citizen scientists in entomology citizen science programs were analyzed using a constructivist grounded theory methodology. We propose the substantive-level theory of transference to describe the social process by which the educational and attitudinal impacts intended by program leaders for the program participants are filtered by citizen scientists and transferred to others. This process involves individual and external phases, each with associated actions. Transference occurred in participants who had maintained a long-term interest in nature, joined a citizen science program, shared science knowledge and experiences, acquired an expert role to others, and influenced change in others. Transference has implications for how citizen scientists are perceived by professional communities, understanding of the broader impacts and contributions of citizen science to wicked problems, program evaluation, and the design of these programs as informal science education opportunities. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Empty puparia are frequently collected at death scenes, especially in cases with a long post mortem interval (PMI). Although we are not able to estimate the interval between the eclosion of an adult fly and the collection of an empty puparium (i.e. the post-eclosion interval (PEI)), empty puparia may still provide valuable evidence about the minimum PMI. However, because of the unknown PEI, it is impossible to determine the time when the fly emerged, and thus when the retrospective calculation of the minimum PMI should start. In this study, the estimation of PMI (or minimum PMI) for empty puparia of Protophormia terraenovae Rob.-Desv. (Calliphoridae) and Stearibia nigriceps Meig. (Piophilidae) was simulated, to gain insight into the changes in estimates, when different PEIs and different temperature conditions were assumed. The simulations showed that the PEI (in a range of 0\u201390\u00a0days) had no effect on the PMI (or minimum PMI) when the puparium was collected in winter or early spring (December\u2013April). In late spring, summer, or autumn (May\u2013November) the PMI (or minimum PMI) increased with the PEI. The increase in PMI was large in the summer months, and surprisingly small in the autumn months, frequently smaller than the PEI used in the estimation. The shortest PMI was always obtained with a PEI of 0, indicating that the true minimum PMI is always estimated using a PEI of 0. When the puparium was collected during spring, simulations indicated that oviposition had occurred in the previous year, while in summer the previous-year oviposition has been indicated by the simulations only when longer PEIs had been assumed. These findings should guide estimation of the PMI (or minimum PMI) based on an empty puparium. \u00a9 2020, The Author(s)."

The Scheimpflug lidar allows an interesting trade-off between high sample rate and low pulse energy for retrieving wing beat harmonics and slow sample rates with high pulse energy for detecting small species far away. In this paper, we review and revise calibration, sizing and associated deficiencies, and report count rates to 104 insects/minute up to 2 km range. We investigate if and how high dynamic range can be exploited in entomological lidar and also how fast and slow sample rates could complement each other and capture a wider span of the biomass spectrum. We demonstrate that smaller insect can be detected further away by long exposures and show consistency between the captured biomass size spectra. However, we find unexpected discrepancies between short and long exposures in the range distributions. We found that vertebrates as well as specular insects can saturate signals. Error sources and limitations are elaborated on.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

Canine ACL cases were investigated in a rural area of Monte Mor, S\u00e3o Paulo, where a human ACL case had been confirmed. Dogs were evaluated through clinical and laboratory diagnosis including serology, cytological tissue preparations and PCR on skin lesions, lymph node and bone marrow samples. Entomological investigations on sandflies trapped in the surroundings of the study area were performed for 14 months. Nyssomyia neivai was the predominant phlebotomine species, comprising 94.65% of the captured specimens (832 out of 879). This species was the most abundant in all trapping sites, including human homes and dog shelters. Ny. whitmani, Migonemyia migonei, Pintomyia monticola, Evandromyia cortellezzii, Pi. fischeri and Expapilata firmatoi were also captured. Two of the three dogs examined were positive for anti-Leishmania IgG in ELISA using the antigen Fucose mannose ligand and skin samples were positive for L. (V.) braziliensis in PCR, but all the samples collected were negative for L. (L.) infantum. One of the dogs had a confirmed persistent infection for more than one year. \u00a9 2021, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology. All rights reserved."

            "text": "Introduction: In order to improve our understanding of the fundamental limits of core interventions and guide efforts based on prioritization and identification of effective/novel interventions with great potentials to interrupt persistent malaria transmission in the context of high vector control coverage, the drivers of persistent disease transmission were investigated in three eco-epidemiological settings; forested areas in Cameroon, coastal area in Kenya and highland areas in Ethiopia. Methods: Mosquitoes were sampled in three eco-epidemiological settings using different entomological sampling techniques and analysed for Plasmodium infection status and blood meal origin in blood-fed specimens. Human behavioural surveys were conducted to assess the knowledge and attitude of the population on malaria and preventive measures, their night activities, and sleeping pattern. The parasitological analysis was conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection in the population using rapid diagnostic tests. Results: Despite the diversity in the mosquito fauna, their biting behaviour was found to be closely associated to human behaviour in the three settings. People in Kenya and Ethiopia were found to be more exposed to mosquito bites during the early hours of the evening (18-21h) while it was in the early morning (4-6 am) in Cameroon. Malaria transmission was high in Cameroon compared to Kenya and Ethiopia with over 50% of the infected bites recorded outdoors. The non-users of LLINs were 2.5 to 3 times more likely to be exposed to the risk of acquiring malaria compared to LLINs users. Malaria prevalence was high (42%) in Cameroon, and more than half of the households visited had at least one individual infected with Plasmodium parasites. Conclusions: The study suggests high outdoor malaria transmission occurring in the three sites with however different determinants driving residual malaria transmission in these areas. \u00a9 2021 World Health Organization, 2021.

The experiment was performed with five diets containing increasing levels of poultry litter (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) replacing the control diet and five replicates with 50 larvae per sample unit. Larval growth and development were evaluated and the chemical compositions of diet and T. molitor larvae were determined. Larval development and reproduction efficiency of T. molitor were similar in all treatments. The sole use of poultry litter to feed T. molitor reduced the crude protein of flour by only 8%. Including 50% or more poultry litter in the standard diet is the best-suited formulation for larvae production and incorporation of minerals in the larvae. Mealworm can be grown successfully on diets composed by poultry litter, the diet did not affect survival, growth, and development; however, studies spanning several insect generations should be performed to determine the effects of diet composition on adult fecundity. The knowledge acquired using poultry litter to feed T. molitor will be useful to carry out new research, in addition to evidencing the possibility of low-cost mass rearing of these larvae.  \u00a9 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

            "text": "The Joint FAO/IAEA Centre (formerly called Division) of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture was established in 1964 and its accompanying laboratories in 1961. One of its subprograms deals with insect pest control, and has the mandate to develop and implement the sterile insect technique (SIT) for selected key insect pests, with the goal of reducing the use of insecticides, reducing animal and crop losses, protecting the environment, facilitating international trade in agricultural commodities and improving human health. Since its inception, the Insect Pest Control Laboratory (IPCL) (formerly named Entomology Unit) has been implementing research in relation to the development of the SIT package for insect pests of crops, livestock and human health. This paper provides a review of research carried out between 2010 and 2020 at the IPCL. Research on plant pests has focused on the development of genetic sexing strains, characterizing and assessing the performance of these strains (e.g., Ceratitis capitata), elucidation of the taxonomic status of several members of the Bactrocera dorsalis and Anastrepha fraterculus complexes, the use of microbiota as probiotics, genomics, supplements to improve the performance of the reared insects, and the development of the SIT package for fruit fly species such as Bactrocera oleae and Drosophila suzukii. Research on livestock pests has focused on colony maintenance and establishment, tsetse symbionts and pathogens, sex separation, morphology, sterile male quality, radiation biology, mating behavior and transportation and release systems. Research with human disease vectors has focused on the development of genetic sexing strains (Anopheles arabiensis, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), the development of a more cost-effective larvae and adult rearing system, assessing various aspects of radiation biology, characterizing symbionts and pathogens, studying mating behavior and the development of quality control procedures, and handling and release methods. During the review period, 13 coordinated research projects (CRPs) were completed and six are still being implemented. At the end of each CRP, the results were published in a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal. The review concludes with an overview of future challenges, such as the need to adhere to a phased conditional approach for the implementation of operational SIT programs, the need to make the SIT more cost effective, to respond with demand driven research to solve the problems faced by the operational SIT programs and the use of the SIT to address a multitude of exotic species that are being introduced, due to globalization, and established in areas where they could not survive before, due to climate change. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This University of Georgia Extension initiative recruited citizen scientists to count for 15 minutes the number and types of insects visiting pollinator plants. The project was web based and used multiple media strategies to recruit citizen scientists, to educate the participants on the entomology required, and to collect the data generated. WordPress website-building software allowed us to create the project website (GGaPC.org). This served as the center of the project as it contained project details and educational materials as well as the portal for uploading count data. The social media outlets Facebook and Instagram were used to promote the project and to provide insect identification and pollinator education, and social media memes were created easily using Canva software. MailChimp emailing services assisted us in providing educational e-newsletters and local counting event newsletters to participants and partners. The Zoom online meeting platform allowed our team to meet with partners and Extension offices across the state to share resources and to plan events. More than 4,600 counts were uploaded, documenting more than 131,000 insect visits tallied from 134 Georgia counties including 135 schools. Multimedia tools allowed us to conduct the project with limited personnel on a small budget while providing comprehensive participant education and an extensive project reach. \u00a9 2021 Terrain.

Most records of this insect are of its association with roots of grasses and sedges, but known hosts also include numerous broadleaved plants both grown outdoors and in greenhouses. Indoor grown Cannabis sativa L., particularly when intensively grown for marijuana production, has also emerged as a common host for this insect in the United States and Canada. On this crop, it has an anholocyclic life cycle where it is almost entirely found in association with plant roots. Colonization of new plants is largely by alate forms that may emerge from soil in large numbers as plants near maturity.  \u00a9 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Community-based decentralized planning and engagement are effective strategies that can make positive behavioral changes to control VBDs. Methods This community-based implementation research was conducted during November 2016\u2013October 2018 in Alappuzha municipality in Kerala, India. It was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, formative research was conducted to know the community\u2019s profile and perceptions and thus to plan and develop an appropriate intervention. Baseline data on some entomological indicators were also collected. These data were used to assess the impact of the intervention by comparing with the post-intervention data. In the second phase, an intervention through the community\u2019s engagement was implemented in selected wards. The activities included the formation of community committees and the vector control and source reduction activities with the community engagement and inter-sectoral coordination. Results The intervention resulted in a positive change among the community to engage in vector control activities. These efforts along with inter-sectoral coordination resulted in successfully implementing vector source reduction activities. In both wards, pre- and post-intervention entomological data (house index: 16.7 vs 6.0 and 64.2 vs. 8.6; container index: 24.8 vs. 12.1 and 37.7 vs. 18.1; and Breteau index: 21.3 vs. 7.3 and 47.7 vs. 8.6) revealed a considerable vector source reduction. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest considering and including community engagement in public health policy as the main thrust to control VBDs. \u00a9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

            "text": "True blister beetles (genus Epicauta, family Meloidae) produce cantharidin, which can cause toxicosis in humans and animals. Some recent reports suggest that poisoning by the blister beetle has occurred in the Mediterranean part of Slovenia, which has never been reported before. Drought and modern harvesting techniques are thought to increase the likelihood of blister beetle forage contamination and cantharidin intoxication in animals. A survey of fields associated with blister beetle contamination was conducted and the Meloid species present were identified. Entomological surveillance was conducted for Mylabris variabilis and Epicauta rufidorsum. Cantharidin concentrations were also measured in both blister beetle species. Cantharidin concentration in Mylabris variabilis (n = 17) ranged from 0.038 to 0.354 \u00b5g/mg (mean 0.151 \u00b5g/mg). Cantharidin concentration in Epicauta rufidorsum (n = 36) ranged from 0.055 to 0.341 \u00b5g/mg (mean 0.142 \u00b5g/mg). Both species exhibited variable concentrations of cantharidin that could not be associated with their biology, sex, age, size, and/or reproductive status. Epicauta rufidorsum have never previously been studied as a possible source of forage contamination, nor have cantharidin concentrations been determined in this species. It is the most likely source of forage contamination due to its abundance in the investigated fields, its swarming activity, and its tendency to reside in the green parts of plants immediately after cutting. Delaying the simultaneous processing and storage of forage after cutting would reduce the likelihood of forage contamination by blister beetles, as they can then retreat to the ground or fly away. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

It is using two methods of killing are injurious machine (knife) and toxic substance (strychnine). Four areas within Karbala governorate studied and identified to know their spread and time of presence on the body during the stages of decomposition. During this experiment, the bodies of dogs used to identify types of insects attracted to the body during four seasons. The results indicated the presence of the species Pullimosina heteroneura (Haliday, 1836) in the first three stages of decomposing the bodies, but in different proportions and the highest was in the wet decomposition of the body for the spring and autumn seasons. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the resistance of Ae.\u00a0aegypti to the insecticide, malathion, in situ. The location of this study was the municipality of Foz do Igua\u00e7u, in the state of Paran\u00e1, Brazil. Methods: Ultra-low-volume (ULV) fogging equipment was used, by vehicle, to apply the insecticide in situ, and mosquito populations after treatment were compared with those of control areas. The resistance of strains collected from the municipality was compared to the Rockefeller strain under laboratory conditions. Results: We found 220 adult female specimens and 7423 eggs of Ae. aegypti in the areas subjected to UBV treatment, whereas 245 adult females and 10\u00a0557 eggs were found in the control areas. The UBV treatment area showed no significant difference compared to the control area, for all the indices. Mortality of the Rockefeller colony varied more quickly when there were slight variations in malathion concentration than the Foz do Igua\u00e7u population. \u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

This choice is influenced by both intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, but little is known of their relative contributions. Blood fed Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from a malaria endemic village in Ghana. Collections were conducted across a range of different host availabilities and from both indoor and outdoor locations. These environmental factors were shown to impact dramatically the host choice of caught malaria vectors: mosquitoes caught indoors were ten-fold more likely to have sourced their blood meal from humans; and a halving in odds of being human-fed was found for mosquitoes caught only 25 m from the centre of the village. For the first time, we demonstrate that anthropophagy was better explained by extrinsic factors (namely, local host availability and indoor/outdoor trapping location) than intrinsic factors (namely, the (sibling) species of the mosquito caught) (respective Akaike information criterion estimates: 243.0 versus 359.8). Instead of characterizing biting behaviour on a taxonomic level, we illustrate the importance of assessing local entomology. Accounting for this behavioural plasticity is important, both in terms of measuring effectiveness of control programmes and in informing optimal disease control strategies. \u00a9 2020, The Author(s)."

The objective of this work was to determine the pesticide potential of essential oils of rosemary pepper (Lippia origanoides Kunth; Verbenaceae), citronella (Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt; Poaceae) and lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus [DC.] Stapf; Poaceae) to control fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda [J.E. Smith]; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Ovicidal, larvicidal and pupicidal activity was evaluated with five dosages (0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.5% and 5.0% v/v) and a negative control (neutral detergent at 5.0% v/v). Unhatched eggs, mortality of caterpillars and non-emerged adults were recorded using ovicidal and pupicidal percentage, and median lethal doses (LD50) to caterpillars. The essential oils showed insecticidal activity on the egg, caterpillar 3rd instars and pupae stages, highlighting the rapid action and high mortality rates caused by the L. origanoides essential oil, which registered, at lowest dosage, average 97.8% ovicidal activity and 81.3% pupicidal activity; in addition to LD50 on 3rd instar caterpillars, 0.001% by exposure and 0.033% by topical application. Essential oils of C. citratus and C. winterianus required longer periods to act and caused significant mortality on the three stages, registering LD50 0.008% and 0.159% for exposure, and 1.151% and 1.348% for topical application, respectively. Citronella oil caused behavioral changes in caterpillars, which reflected flight and aggressiveness. Therefore, these three essential oils can be an alternative for management of fall armyworm, with the potential to hinder and reduce its biotic potential. \u00a9 2020, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

            "text": "Background: Although long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the most effective tool for preventing malaria parasite transmission, the nets have some limitations. For example, the increase of LLIN use has induced the rapid expansion of mosquito insecticide resistance. More than two persons often share one net, which increases the infection risk. To overcome these problems, two new mosquito nets were developed, one incorporating piperonyl butoxide and another covering ceilings and open eaves. We designed a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) to evaluate these nets based on the information provided in the present preliminary study. Results: Nearly 75% of the anopheline population in the study area in western Kenya was Anopheles gambiae s. l., and the remaining was Anopheles funestus s. l. More female anophelines were recorded in the western part of the study area. The number of anophelines increased with rainfall. We planned to have 80% power to detect a 50% reduction in female anophelines between the control group and each intervention group. The between-cluster coefficient of variance was 0.192. As the number of clusters was limited to 4 due to the size of the study area, the estimated cluster size was 7 spray catches with an alpha of 0.05. Of 1619 children tested, 626 (48%) were Plasmodium falciparum positive using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). The prevalence was higher in the northwestern part of the study area. The number of children who slept under bed nets was 929 (71%). The P. falciparum RDT-positive prevalence (RDTpfPR) of net users was 45%, and that of non-users was 55% (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.56, 0.95). Using 45% RDTpfPR of net users, we expected each intervention to reduce prevalence by 50%. The intracluster correlation coefficient was 0.053. With 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, the estimated cluster size was 116 children. Based on the distribution of children, we modified the boundaries of the clusters and established 300-m buffer zones along the boundaries to minimize a spillover effect. Conclusions: The cRCT study design is feasible. As the number of clusters is limited, we will apply a two-stage procedure with the baseline data to evaluate each intervention. \u00a9 2020, The Author(s)."

            "text": "Background: Mosquito-proofing of houses using wire mesh screens is gaining greater recognition as a practical intervention for reducing exposure to malaria transmitting mosquitoes. Screening potentially protects all persons sleeping inside the house against transmission of mosquito-borne diseases indoors. The study assessed the effectiveness of house eaves screening in reducing indoor vector densities and malaria prevalence in Nyabondo, western Kenya. Methods: 160 houses were selected for the study, with half of them randomly chosen for eaves screening with fibre-glass coated wire mesh (experimental group) and the other half left without screening (control group). Randomization was carried out by use of computer-generated list in permuted blocks of ten houses and 16 village blocks, with half of them allocated treatment in a ratio of 1:1. Cross-sectional baseline entomological and parasitological data were collected before eave screening. After baseline data collection, series of sampling of indoor adult mosquitoes were conducted once a month in each village using CDC light traps. Three cross-sectional malaria parasitological surveys were conducted at three month intervals after installation of the screens. The primary outcome measures were indoor Anopheles mosquito density and malaria parasite prevalence. Results: A total of 15,286 mosquitoes were collected over the two year period using CDC light traps in 160 houses distributed over 16 study villages (mean mosquitoes = 4.35, SD = 11.48). Of all mosquitoes collected, 2,872 (18.8%) were anophelines (2,869 Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, 1 Anopheles funestus and 2 other Anopheles spp). Overall, among An. gambiae collected, 92.6% were non-blood fed, 3.57% were blood fed and the remaining 0.47% were composed of gravid and half gravid females. More indoor adult mosquitoes were collected in the control than experimental arms of the study. Results from cross-sectional parasitological surveys showed that screened houses recorded relatively low malaria parasite prevalence rates compared to the control houses. Overall, malaria prevalence was 5.6% (95% CI: 4.2-7.5) n = 1,918, with baseline prevalence rate of 6.1% (95% CI: 3.9-9.4), n = 481 and 3rd follow-up survey prevalence of 3.6% (95% CI: 2.0-6.8) n = 494. At all the three parasitological follow-up survey points, house screening significantly reduced the malaria prevalence by 100% (p < 0.001), 63.6% (p = 0.026), and 100% (p < 0.001) in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd follow-up surveys respectively. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that house eave screening has potential to reduce indoor vector densities and malaria prevalence in high transmission areas.  \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)."

            "text": "Background: Malaria is a life threating vector borne disease caused by different Plasmodium parasites. Metema and Armachiho are two of the top five malaria endemic areas among the districts of Amhara region in Ethiopia. Transmission pattern is seasonal and migrant laborers who visit these areas for employment in mechanized agriculture are highly affected. The aim of this study was to investigate seasonal abundance, abdominal status and parity rate of An.gambiae s.l in Metema-Armachiho lowlands, Northwest Ethiopia. Method: A 1 year longitudinal entomological study was conducted in Metema-Armachiho lowlands from June 2016-May 2017. Mosquitoes were collected using CDC-light traps in indoor and outdoor sites for four consecutive days in each month. A total of eight standard battery operated CDC-light traps were used to collect mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes were classed as unfed, fed or gravid under a dissecting microscope. The ovaries of all unfed An.gambiae s.l mosquitoes were examined for evidence of parity. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS-20 software. Chi-square test was applied to show significant difference between variables. P-value< 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Results: Of the total 1253 mosquitoes collected, 713 (552 female, 161 male) were culex and 540 (501 female, 39 male) were An.gambiae s.l. About 50.9% were collected in June-August 2016, 21.7% in September-November 2016, 12.0% in December 2016-February 2017 and 15.4% in March to May 2017. Of the total, 57.2 and 42.8% of the An.gambiae s.l were collected from indoor and outdoor sites respectively. Of the total females collected, 76.8% were unfed; of which 69.4% were parous. Significantly higher number of female An.gambiae s.l were collected in indoor and there was significant difference in abdominal status of An.gambiae s.l mosquitoes collected in different season (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Highest number of An.gambiae s.l was observed from June-August followed by September-November. The parity rate of An.gambiae s.l was high and there was significant difference in abdominal status of An.gambiae s.l collected in different season. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)."

In this review, we provide an update on the current status of forensic entomology research and its application in relation to estimation of post-mortem interval in various criminal investigations ranging from murder cases, cases of human neglect and the poaching of wildlife in southern Africa, among other issues. A literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and EBSCOhost databases. The studies reviewed were focused on arthropod diversity during different stages of carcass decomposition, effect of seasons on the abundance and diversity of carrion feeding arthropod species during carcass decomposition, and diurnal and nocturnal oviposition of forensically important insect species during carcass decomposition. It was further observed that arthropod species that established on a decomposing carcass are potentially useful in the estimation of post-mortem interval and determining clues in cases of criminal investigations. The review confirmed the paucity of research in forensic entomology, and its application in southern Africa. Future studies on the research and application of forensic entomology in various criminal investigation scenarios - such as murder cases, human neglect, and wildlife poaching in southern Africa - are therefore needed. Significance: \u2022 Forensic entomology research and its application is lagging in southern Africa. \u2022 There is seasonal variation in the arthropod species used for estimation of post-mortem intervals in southern Africa. \u2022 Identification of arthropod species diversity in the region has potential for application in forensic investigations. \u00a9 2020.

            "text": "Background: Mosquitoes are vectors of many tropical diseases. Understanding the ecology of local mosquito vectors, such as species composition, distributions, population dynamics, and species diversity is important for designing the optimal strategy to control the mosquito-borne diseases. Methods: Entomological surveillance of adult mosquitoes was conducted in five sites representing different ecological settings across Hainan Island from January to December of 2018 using BG Sentinel (BGS) traps and Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) light traps. In each site, we selected three areas representing urban, suburban and rural settings. Eighteen trap-days were sampled in each setting at each site, and CDC light traps and BGS traps were setup simultaneously. Mosquito species composition, distribution, population dynamics, and species diversity were analyzed. Mosquito densities were compared between different study sites and between different settings. Results: Nine species of mosquitoes belonging to four genera were identified. Culex quinquefasciatus (80.8%), Armigeres subalbatus (13.0%) and Anopheles sinensis (3.1%) were the top three species collected by CDC light traps; Cx. quinquefasciatus (91.9%), Ae. albopictus (5.1%), and Ar. subalbatus (2.8%) were the top three species collected by BGS traps. Predominant species varied among study sites. The population dynamics of Ae. albopictus, An. sinensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus showed clear seasonal variation regardless of study sites with a varied peak season for different species. Mosquito abundance of all species showed significant differences among different study sites and among urban, suburban and rural areas. Danzhou had the highest mosquito biodiversity, with an \u03b1, \u03b2, and Gini-Simpson biodiversity index of 8, 1.13 and 0.42, respectively. BGS traps captured Aedes mosquito at a higher efficiency than CDC light traps, whereas CDC light traps captured significantly more Anopheles and Armigeres mosquitoes than BGS traps. Conclusions: Mosquitoes were abundant on Hainan Island with clear seasonality and spatial heterogeneity. Population density, species composition, distribution, and species diversity were strongly affected by the natural environment. Different tools are required for the surveillance of different mosquito species.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)."

These samples were subjected to serological tests using the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to molecular test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, a Phlebotomine sandflies survey was performed in the same shelters. The analyses revealed a positivity of 31.91% (30/94) through ELISA and 29.79% (28/94) through IFAT. The two serological tests showed a positive association with perfect agreement (k\u00a0=\u00a00.925). None of the cats were positive by Leishmania spp. DNA. One Lutzomyia (Lutzomyia) longipalpis male was found in one of the cat shelters. The results and the implications of our findings are discussed below. \u00a9 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"

Quebec has a very recent history of viticultural entomology as the first artisanal permit for wine making was issued by the Quebec Government in 1985, and the first formal research project about arthropods associated with vineyards was initiated in 1997. The Quebec viticultural industry has consistently developed over ca. 35 years and, given the prospects of global warming, warmer abiotic conditions will allow to cultivate cultivars of better oenological value. Meanwhile, some invasive species that recently arrived in Quebec are causing concerns because they are threatening the sustainability of pest management programs. In this article, we will review of the evolution of entomological research in Quebec vineyards. We will then treat technology transfer activities that allowed to translate research results into protection programs. Finally, we will discuss new and coming entomological problems that are challenging the sustainability of pest management programs in Quebec vineyards. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

However, residual applications of a spatial repellent such as transfluthrin could allow mosquitoes the opportunity to escape, only inducing mortality if insects linger, for example after becoming trapped in a treated tent. In this study we investigated the capability of transfluthrin on 2 types of US military material to reduce natural populations of disease vector mosquitoes in a cool-arid desert field environment in southern California. We found that transfluthrin could reduce Culex tarsalis incursion into protected areas by up to 100% upon initial treatment and up to 45% for at least 16 days posttreatment, showing that this compound could be an effective element in the US Department of Defense integrated vector management system appropriate for further study. \u00a9 2020 American Mosquito Control Association.

            "text": "Suicide by hanging is one of the most common causes of death, worldwide. Therefore, studies of insects associated with hanging cadavers are important for developing entomological tools capable of estimating the postmortem intervals in such cases. We conducted a two-year experiment, in the spring, summer, and autumn of 2012 and 2013, studying the entomofauna of 12 hanging and 12 ground, decomposing pig carcasses in a hornbeam-oak forest, in western Poland. Both carcass treatments showed colonization by similar insect species. Among the 224 taxa collected, 61 and 52 were minimally abundant (\u226510 individuals) during the adult stage on at least one hanging and at least one ground carcass, respectively. During the spring and autumn, more adult flies were attracted to hanging carcasses, whereas during the summer, their numbers were similar on both hanging and ground carcasses. Adult beetles were higher in number on hanging carcasses during the spring, but during the summer and autumn, they were slightly more abundant on ground pig carcasses. Irrespective of the carcass treatment, Dryomyzidae, Muscidae, and Piophilidae were the most abundant flies, whereas representatives of Geotrupidae, Histeridae, and Silphidae were the dominant families in the studied beetle community. Only Anoplotrupes stercorosus (Scriba) and Hydrotaea similis Meade adults and Calliphora vomitoria (Linnaeus) larvae reached minimal abundance on all carcasses during all seasons. Carcass treatment only affected the numbers of minimally abundant fly species at the larval stage due to their higher numbers on ground pig carcasses. Although differences in the residency patterns of insects were observed between carcass treatments, they were not significant. In general, adult insects tended to be present for slightly longer times on hanging carcasses than on ground carcasses, whereas beetle larvae had longer presences on ground pig carcasses. Fly larvae were present on ground carcasses for the same amount of time as on hanging carcasses. More broken residency patterns were observed among the adult insects and beetle larvae that colonized hanging carcasses. Fly larvae that colonized ground carcasses had more breaks within the presence periods than fly larvae colonizing hanging carcasses. Neither treatment significantly affected the time of insect appearance on carrion. Most species appeared at the same time or at within one- or two-day intervals on both treatments. Seasonal differences in insect appearance were found, with most species colonizing quickly during the summer. The implications of these findings for forensic entomology are discussed. \u00a9 2020 The Authors"

These morphotypes are among the oldest straight-jawed neuropteran larvae described. According to the morphology of the specimens and the taphonomy of the amber pieces where they are embedded, the described forms are regarded as active predators of small soft-bodied arthropods, probably living among bark or other vegetation of the resin-producing forest although they could have frequented the soil. An account of the diversity of larval Neuropterida described and/or figured from amber localities worldwide is provided, including reassessments of some specimens. The gathering diversity of fossil immature neuropterans, like that of their adult counterparts, already leans towards reflecting a greater diversity and disparity of the group in deep time \u2012particularly during the Cretaceous\u2012 than in modern days, and it is worthy of increased research efforts due to the evolutionary and palaeobiological potential that it holds. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

            "text": "Hastisetae are a specific group of detachable setae characterizing the larvae of Megatominae (Coleoptera: Dermestidae), commonly known as carpet and khapra beetles. These setae are located on both thoracic and abdominal tergites and they are the primary defense of the larva against invertebrate predators. According to previous studies, the main purpose of hastisetae is to work as a mechanical obstacle, but they are also capable to block and kill a predator. Hastisetae, single or aggregate, function as an extremely efficient mechanical trap, based on an entangling mechanism of cuticular structures (spines and hairs) and body appendages (antennae, legs and mouthparts). It is believed that this defensive system evolved primarily to contrast predation by invertebrates, however it has been observed that hastisetae may affect vertebrates as well. Although information on the impacts of vertebrate predators of the beetles is lacking, hastisetae have been shown to be a possible threat for human health as an important contaminant of stored products (food and fabric), work and living environment. Review of past and recent literature on dermestid larvae has revealed that despite these structures indicated as one of the distinctive characters in species identification, very little is known about their ultrastructure, evolution and mechanism of action. In the present work, we will provide the state of knowledge on hastisetae in Dermestidae and we will present and discuss future research perspectives intended to bridge the existing knowledge gaps. \u00a9 2020"

While epidemiology data sets are increasingly deposited in databases and repositories, barriers to access still remain. ClinEpiDB was constructed as an open-access online resource for clinical and epidemiologic studies by leveraging the extensive web toolkit and infrastructure of the Eukaryotic Pathogen Database Resources (EuPathDB; a collection of databases covering 170+ eukaryotic pathogens, relevant related species, and select hosts) combined with a unified semantic web framework. Here we present an intuitive point-and-click website that allows users to visualize and subset data directly in the ClinEpiDB browser and immediately explore potential associations. Supporting study documentation aids contextualization, and data can be downloaded for advanced analyses. By facilitating access and interrogation of high-quality, large-scale data sets, ClinEpiDB aims to spur collaboration and discovery that improves global health. \u00a9 2020 Ruhamyankaka E et al."

To investigate the insects' flight behavior and their response to winds, entomological radar has proved to be a particularly valuable tool; however, its observations of insect orientation are ambiguous with regard to the head/tail direction, and this greatly hinders interpretation of the migrants' flight behavior. We have developed two related methods of using wind data to resolve the head/tail ambiguity, and we have compared their outputs with those from simply assigning the heading direction to be that which is closer to the track direction. We applied all three methods to observations of Australian plague locust migrations made with an insect monitoring radar. For the study dataset, some of the headings selected by the simpler method are shown to be clearly incorrect. The two new methods generally agree and reveal a significantly different, and presumably more accurate, relationship of heading direction to track direction. However, use of these methods leads to quite a large proportion of the sample being lost because the wind values, which derive from a regional-scale numerical model, are shown to be incompatible with the radar observations. This exploratory study has moreover demonstrated that locusts are frequently oriented at a large angle to their track and that quite often their movement is at least slightly tailfirst. Both new methods appear to be a significant improvement on the simpler method. As well as providing an accurate representation of migratory flight behavior, they allow occasions when the model wind values are unreliable to be eliminated from the data sample. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

            "text": "Background: Quantification of adult Aedes aegypti abundance indoors has relied on estimates of relative density (e.g. number of adults per unit of sampling or time), most commonly using traps or timed collections using aspirators. The lack of estimates of the sensitivity of collections and lack of a numerical association between relative and the absolute density of adult Ae. aegypti represent a significant gap in vector surveillance. Here, we describe the use of sequential removal sampling to estimate absolute numbers of indoor resting Ae. aegypti and to calculate calibration coefficients for timed Prokopack aspirator collections in the city of Merida, Yucatan State, Mexico. The study was performed in 200 houses that were selected based on recent occurrence of Aedes-borne viral illness in residents. Removal sampling occurred in 10-minute sampling rounds performed sequentially until no Ae. aegypti adult was collected for 3 hours or over 2 consecutive 10-minute periods. Results: A total of 3439 Ae. aegypti were collected. The sensitivity of detection of positive houses in the first sampling round was 82.5% for any adult Ae. aegypti, 78.5% for females, 75.5% for males and 73.3% for blood-fed females. The total number of Ae. aegypti per house was on average ~5 times higher than numbers collected for the first sampling round. There was a positive linear relationship between the relative density of Ae. aegypti collected during the first 10-min round and the absolute density for all adult metrics. Coefficients from the linear regression were used to calibrate numbers from 10-min collections into estimates of absolute indoor Ae. aegypti density for all adults, females and males. Conclusions: Exhaustive removal sampling represents a promising method for quantification of absolute indoor Ae. aegypti density, leading to improved entomological estimates of mosquito distribution, a key measure in the assessments of the risk pathogen transmission, disease modeling and the evaluation of vector control interventions. \u00a9 2019 The Author(s)."

Seeds of okra (Subz pari) were sown on 7th February 2017 in a complete randomized block design with three replications. The biocontrol agents, lacewing and Trichogramma (1300 eggs/card) each were released. Lacewing was found very effective against aphid, jassid and whitefly in the field. Aphid was found at early stage of crop and touched the maximum level in mid-February, therefore its population decreased quickly. Jassid increased linearly and was high after 6th week of observation and then decreased subsequently till picking of the crop. On the other hand, whitefly population increased linearly till 9th week of observation and then decreased and eventually disappeared from the crop on 19th week of observation. Trichogramma was observed as a main natural enemy of spotted bollworm of okra and reduced bollworm population. The population of bollworm increased slowly till harvesting of the crop. It is concluded from the present study that both the bio-control agents successfully lowered the populations of sucking and chewing insect pests and bollworms of okra. Lacewing was found effective against sucking insect pests while Trichogram efficiently controlled bollworms and are recommended for field applications. These bio-control agents can also be incorporated in IPM strategy. \u00a9 2018 EScience Press. All rights reserved."

The accuracy of insect age estimates in a forensic context is reduced by large intraspecific variation in insect development time. Here we test the concept that insect size at emergence may be used to predict insect physiological age and accordingly to improve the accuracy of age estimates in forensic entomology. Using results of laboratory study on development of forensically-useful beetle Creophilus maxillosus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Staphylinidae) we demonstrate that its physiological age at emergence [i.e. thermal summation value (K) needed for emergence] fall with an increase of beetle size. In the validation study it was found that K estimated based on the adult insect size was significantly closer to the true K as compared to K from the general thermal summation model. Using beetle length at emergence as a predictor variable and male or female specific model regressing K against beetle length gave the most accurate predictions of age. These results demonstrate that size of C. maxillosus at emergence improves accuracy of age estimates in a forensic context. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

NAs bind electrostatically to Q-paper, but the quantity of NA bound depends on the paper's binding capacity. To optimize the original technology for mosquito surveillance, factors that affected NA absorbance on Q-paper were evaluated. Sixteen variations of Q-paper were prepared with modifications of the derivatizing reagents and derivatization temperature. The binding capacities of these variations were determined first with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic (BTCA), then viral RNA (purified or in infected mosquito samples) was used for validation. For this, samples with Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) RNA or virus-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito bodies were applied to sixteen Q-paper variants. Washing the paper samples with water versus elution with aqueous salt (1 M) gave samples that were analyzed for viral RNA by a PCR-based direct Luminex hybridization assay. The comparison ranked the Q-paper binding capacities from the lowest to the highest. The Q-paper with the highest RNA binding capability was further validated with ZIKV- and CHIKV-infected mosquito saliva. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V."

We designed trials to assess the performance of an alternative human-baited double net trap (HDN) for field Aedes albopictus monitoring compared with the standard HLC. Methods: Outdoor HDN and HLC catches were conducted simultaneously at 15 field sites on two sunny days in mid-July and August. The tests were performed 3 h apart: an early morning period (7:30-8:30 h), a pre-sunset period (16:30-17:30 h) and a post-sunset period (18:30-19:30 h). A total of 90 comparisons were made between the two methods. Field comparisons were designed to minimize half-hour bias and human-bait attraction bias. Results: Two mosquito species were collected by HDN and HLC, with the predominated species being Ae. albopictus (HDN: n = 1325, 97.35% of total; HLC: n = 531, 92.51% of total). A small proportion were adults of the Culex pipiens complex (HDN: n = 36, 2.65% of total; HLC: n = 43, 7.49% of total). Although the mean Ae. albopictus catch per hour of HLC was significantly higher than HDN (14.72 vs 5.90 per h, t (178) = 3.151, P = 0.003), there were significant positive spatial and temporal correlations between HLC and HDN for Ae. albopictus sampling among different sites and hours (r (90) = 0.785, P < 0.001; r (90) = 0.785, P < 0.001). Both methods proved that Ae. albopictus was most active during the hours before sunset and least active after sunset. No significant variation was observed in Ae. albopictus catch size of HDN between groups of more attractive and less attractive humans (3.38 vs 2.51 per 30 min, t (88) = 1.283, P = 0.201). Conclusions: With moderate sampling efficiency, significantly positive spatial correlation with HLC, and less human-bait attraction bias, HDN appears to be a safer alternative to HLC for Ae. albopictus monitoring in Shanghai. With mosquito activity peaking in the pre-sunset hours, Ae. albopictus catches of HDN should be performed in the hours before dark. The trap design could be improved to make it more portable and easier for field operation. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."

The impact of these outreach efforts can be influenced by many things, but the instructional delivery method can affect how students are exposed to new topics or how confident teachers feel about incorporating new concepts into the classroom. A study was conducted with a series of university entomology outreach programs using insects as a vehicle for teaching environmental education. These programs were used to assess differences between three of the most common university-based outreach delivery methods (Scientist in the Classroom, Teacher Training Workshops, and Online Curriculum) for their effect on student interest and teacher self-efficacy. Surveys administered to 20 fifth grade classrooms found that the delivery method might not be as important as simply getting insects into activities. This study found that the lessons had a significant impact on student interest in environmental and entomological topics, regardless of treatment. All students found the lessons to be more interesting, valuable, and important over the course of the year. Treatment also did not influence teacher self-efficacy, as it remained high for all teachers. \u00a9 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Here, I summarize and criticise the claims that have been made by comparative phylogenetic and fossil studies, and identify some future opportunities. We know the fossil record and phylogeny of insects much better than we did 10\u00a0years ago. We cannot simply ascribe the richness of insects, or their subtaxa, to either age or diversification rate. There is evidence that fossil family richness peaked much earlier than previously suspected. Phylogenetic evidence, however, suggests that species-level net diversification rates are accelerating, though this is highly variable across taxa, implying ongoing changes in global taxonomic composition. Although there is evidence that wings and metamorphosis have had some macroevolutionary effects, the most definitive broad phylogenetic study does not suggest that they directly elevated net diversification of species. There is little evidence that insect body size influences net diversification rate. Compared to other phyla, arthropod richness, of which insects comprise the major part, is best explained by non-marine habit, presence of parasitic lifestyles, a skeleton, vision, and dioecy. Herbivory cannot yet robustly be said to increase diversification over other diets across all insects: there are contrary analyses, and effects differ in different taxa. Many phylogenetic studies now document how it sometimes does: from co-speciation, to diffuse co-evolution with host shifting. The last decade has shown that climate change and biogeographic processes are likely important in generating or limiting insect diversification, but there is a need for greater statistical rigour in such studies. There is also a need to understand the validity of some widely used statistical methods better, and to make better use of the data and methods that exist. Macroevolutionary entomology could greatly benefit from online data integration platforms to facilitate analyses of broader scope. \u00a9 2018 The Netherlands Entomological Society"

Some representatives of flesh flies are one of the dominant necrophagous insects during early stages of decomposition, demonstrating unique biological characteristics compared with other necrophagous flies. Moreover, they lead to global health concerns as carriers of various pathogenic micro-organisms, and dominantly result in the traumatic myiasis. Thus, sarcophagid flies are considered important in decomposition processes for PMI                             min                              estimation. However, the utility of sarcophagid flies has been seriously hampered by limited ecological, biological and taxonomic knowledge of them. The aim of this paper is to provide a brief review on the species, distribution and biological habit of forensically important sarcophagid flies. In addition, the relation between traumatic myiasis and flesh flies, molecular identification methods and developmental pattern of flesh flies are summarized.                          \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

Therefore, we assessed the spatial and temporal variation of mosquitoes in the domestic environment, as well as the nocturnal biting behavior and infection patterns of the main malaria vectors in Rwanda. For this purpose, mosquitoes were collected monthly from 2010 to 2013 by human landing catches (HLC) and pyrethrum spray collections (PSC) in seven sentinel sites. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological characteristics and PCR. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection rates were determined using ELISA. A total of 340,684 mosquitoes was collected by HLC and 73.8% were morphologically identified as culicines and 26.2% as anophelines. Of the latter, 94.3% were Anopheles gambiae s.l., 0.4% Anopheles funestus and 5.3% other Anopheles species. Of An. gambiae s.l., An. arabiensis and An. gambiae s.s. represented 84.4% and 15.6%, respectively. Of all An. gambiae s.l. collected indoor and outdoor, the proportion collected indoors was 51.3% in 2010 and 44.9% in 2013. A total of 17,022 mosquitoes was collected by PSC of which 20.5% were An. gambiae s.l. and 79.5% were culicines. For the seven sentinel sites, the mean indoor density for An. gambiae s.l. varied from 0.0 to 1.0 mosquitoes/house/night. P. falciparum infection rates in mosquitoes varied from 0.87 to 4.06%. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) ranged from 1.0 to 329.8 with an annual average of 99.5 infective bites/person/year. This longitudinal study shows, for the first time, the abundance, species composition, and entomological inoculation rate of malaria mosquitoes collected throughout Rwanda. \u00a9 2018 The Authors"

Though less common as pests, false wireworms (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) may also be problematic in situations that favor wireworms. In addition, cereal aphids vector viruses that cause barley yellow dwarf, a serious and widespread wheat disease. Scientific journal publications, review articles, and management guidebooks on wheat insect pests were consulted to determine the extent and intensity that these pests impose on wheat production in the United States. Widespread outbreaks occur infrequently, but local outbreaks happen nearly every year for the three major pests and cause several millions of dollars in crop losses annually. Hessian fly perennially threatens wheat in the southeastern United States, and wireworms are persistent pests in northwestern wheat-production systems. Otherwise, the particular location and severity of outbreaks vary yearly and are largely unpredictable. However, particular agronomic practices can greatly reduce risk of infestation such as elimination of volunteer wheat and weedy hosts and planting wheat during periods of reduced pest abundance. In addition, resistant cultivars can limit Hessian fly and Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia [Kurdjumov]) damage in some areas, but virulent biotypes of each pest complicate their management. Although several preemptive tactics reliably suppress infestations and barley yellow dwarf severity, they are not compatible in all agricultural systems. Consequently, insecticides are necessary in certain areas and within particular production systems to manage major early-season insect pests of wheat. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2018."

The benefits of the BSC to science include the completion of major cooperative projects to acquire and synthesise knowledge (documenting faunas in the Yukon, Canadian grasslands, and other significant regions and habitats), the assembly and organisation of information and specimens, and improved communication among entomologists. Its efforts have led to valuable monographs, scientific briefs, newsletters, and other products summarised here, including documents that are also useful to those outside entomology. Key operating principles of the BSC are identified. In particular, decisions come from broadly based scientific considerations, an approach to understanding the fauna that guarantees the scientific relevance of the work and is not offset by political or other influences. Core work is planned over the long term to ensure collaboration, focus, efficiency, integrity, quality, productivity, and delivery. The achievements of the BSC over many years confirm the effectiveness of this model for scientific cooperation. \u00a9 Entomological Society of Canada 2017."

The presence of nonprotein components in the silk has not been well explained. In the present study, methods based on gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry were used to identify the metabolites in the cocoon silk from a wild silkworm and two domestic silkworm strains. In total, 45 metabolites were in the cocoon silk, including organic acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and hydrocarbons. Comparative analyses revealed that 17 metabolites were significant more in the wild silkworm cocoon than in the domestic silkworm cocoon, including three organic acids, three fatty acids, three aldoses, four sugar alcohols, three hydrocarbons, and pyridine. Of them, citric acid in the wild silkworm cocoon is more than 40 times that in the domestic silkworm cocoon, which may have protective value against microbes. The carbohydrate, lipid, and the long-chain hydrocarbons may act as water repellent to make the pupa survive longer in the dry environment. Many metabolites in the cocoon silk may play roles to improve the silk resistance. Lots of nonprotein components were identified in the silk for the first time, providing useful data for understanding the biological function of the cocoon silk. \u00a9 The Authors 2017.

            "text": "Background: There is very limited data available on the prevalence of Bancroftian filariasis in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Considerable attempts to eliminate the disease had occurred in the Pacific region by the year 2003, and the prevalence in FSM was thought to be sufficiently low that the region was considered non-endemic. However, a survey conducted in 2003 on an isolated atoll of FSM, Satawal Island, challenged that assumption. Methods: Participants on Satawal Island were recruited and their blood tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen by the filariasis immunochromatographic test (ICT) card and circulating microfilaria by Knott's concentration technique. A survey for active cases of lymphoedema, elephantiasis and hydrocoele was performed and mosquitoes were trapped and dissected to detect larvae of W. bancrofti. Results: A total of 104 males and 149 females from early teens to mid-80s were tested. Men had a significantly higher prevalence of infection than women in both the ICT test (53 vs 28%; p < 0.001) and by Knott's concentration results (37 vs 11%; p < 0.001). Microfilaria prevalence was higher in subjects \u226425 than in those >25 years of age. All persons sampled were treated for LF. No cases of elephantiasis or hydrocoele were detected. No Aedes dissected were positive but three of nine culicine mosquitoes were positive for L1-3 larval stages of W. bancrofti by microscopy. In depth interviews were conducted with residents and chiefs. Conclusions: This survey showed that even in regions thought to be close to elimination, isolated high intensity foci of lymphatic filariasis may occur. These need to be recognized and control measures instituted such as local MDA as in the current study. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s)."

Here, we present the GrabFP system, a collection of four nanobody-based GFP-traps that localize to defined positions along the apical-basal axis. We show that the localization preference of the GrabFP traps can impose a novel localization on GFP-tagged target proteins and results in their controlled mislocalization. These new tools were used to mislocalize transmembrane and cytoplasmic GFP fusion proteins in the Drosophila wing disc epithelium and to investigate the effect of protein mislocalization. Furthermore, we used the GrabFP system as a tool to study the extracellular dispersal of the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) protein and show that the Dpp gradient forming in the lateral plane of the Drosophila wing disc epithelium is essential for patterning of the wing imaginal disc. \u00a9 Harmansa et al."

            "text": "The application of insect and arthropod information to medicolegal death investigations is one of the more exacting applications of entomology. Historically limited to homicide investigations, the integration of full time forensic entomology services to the medical examiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in Harris County has opened up the opportunity to apply entomology to a wide variety of manner of death classifications and types of scenes to make observations on a number of different geographical and species-level trends in Harris County, Texas, USA. In this study, a retrospective analysis was made of 203 forensic entomology cases analyzed during the course of medicolegal death investigations performed by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences in Houston, TX, USA from January 2013 through April 2016. These cases included all manner of death classifications, stages of decomposition and a variety of different scene types that were classified into decedents transported from the hospital (typically associated with myiasis or sting allergy; 3.0%), outdoor scenes (32.0%) or indoor scenes (65.0%). Ambient scene air temperature at the time scene investigation was the only significantly different factor observed between indoor and outdoor scenes with average indoor scene temperature being slightly cooler (25.2C) than that observed outdoors (28.0C). Relative humidity was not found to be significantly different between scene types. Most of the indoor scenes were classified as natural (43.3%) whereas most of the outdoor scenes were classified as homicides (12.3%). All other manner of death classifications came from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Several species were found to be significantly associated with indoor scenes as indicated by a binomial test, including Blaesoxipha plinthopyga (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), all Sarcophagidae (including B. plinthopyga), Megaselia scalaris Loew (Diptera: Phoridae), Synthesiomyia nudiseta Wulp (Diptera: Muscidae) and Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae). The only species that was a significant indicator of an outdoor scene was Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae). All other insect species that were collected in five or more cases were collected from both indoor and outdoor scenes. A species list with month of collection and basic scene characteristics with the length of the estimated time of colonization is also presented. The data presented here provide valuable casework related species data for Harris County, TX and nearby areas on the Gulf Coast that can be used to compare to other climate regions with other species assemblages and to assist in identifying new species introductions to the area. This study also highlights the importance of potential sources of uncertainty in preparation and interpretation of forensic entomology reports from different scene types. \u00a9 2017 Michelle R.

The analysis of their diversity and temporal variation contributes to the understanding of their biology and ecology in one of the most endemic areas of the country. Objectives: To analyze triatominae diversity in two regions of Santander. Materials and methods: We analyzed the triatomine records for Santander contained in the CINTROPUIS entomology lab database. We grouped the information for two regions: the Middle Magdalena area and the Andean region, and for each one we designed species accumulation and range-abundance curves, we calculated diversity and equality indices, and we analyzed colonization and temporal variation or persistence of the community. Results: Ninety five percent of triatomines came from the Andean area and 4.57% from Magdalena Medio, with nine and ten species each. The dominant species in the Andean area were Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata while in Magdalena Medio they were Rhodnius pallescens and Panstrongylus geniculatus. We found a greater diversity and richness in Middle Magdalena compared to the Andean area. The temporal variation showed persistence of communities over time. Conclusions: Results revealed differences in the diversity of the two regions and the potential of wild species to occupy artificial ecotopes. Triatomines intrusion and the recent involvement of wild species in the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi emphasize the need to further investigate the ecology of these vectors in order to guide population control strategies."

In addition to the three previously recognised taxa (M. coriacea Laporte, 1835, M. im\u00adbricata (Wollaston, 1871) and M. lanio (Fabricius, 1775)) we describe a new, cryptic, species from the central Mediterranean area, which can be distinguished from M. coriacea on both DNA sequence data and morphology, and provide a key to known species of the genus. Based on the study of genotyped material, both recent and archival, as well as the examination of a large number of museum specimens, we show that M. lepidoptera sp. n. occurs to the apparent exclusion of M. coriacea on Corsica, Sardinia and islands of the Tuscan Archipelago, but that both taxa are found in peninsular Italy, where they may occasionally hybridize. In the absence of the original type series, we designate a neotype for M. coriacea, and take the opportunity to designate a lectotype for M. lanio. Morphological variation in Meladema species is dis\u00adcussed, including that seen in known and presumed hybrids. Our study highlights the incomplete state of knowledge of Mediterranean biodiversity, even in relatively large, supposedly well-studied taxa. \u00a9 2017 Pensoft Publishers."

In 2016, a fully decomposed body of an unknown adult male was discovered in a high mountainous forest during winter in Chiang Mai province. The remains were infested heavily with thousands of blow fly larvae feeding simultaneously on them. Morphological identification of adults reared from the larvae, and molecular analysis based on sequencing of 1,247 bp partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (CO1) of the larvae and puparia, confirmed the above mentioned 3 species. The approving forensic fly evidence by molecular approach was described for the first time in Thailand. Moreover, neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of the CO1 was performed to compare the relatedness of the species, thereby affirming the accuracy of identification. As species of entomofauna varies among cases in different geographic and climatic circumstances, C. pinguis and L. porphyrina were added to the list of Thai forensic entomology caseworks, including colonizers of human remains in open, high mountainous areas during winter. Further research should focus on these 3 species, for which no developmental data are currently available. \u00a9 2017, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine."

Using the silkworm, Bombyx mori, we show that the juvenile hormone analogue fenoxycarb affects the cascade of ecdysone regulated genes that control the programmed cell death in the larval midgut. Morphological changes that occur during cell death were investigated by studying crosssections of the midgut stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Apoptosis-specific DNA fragmentation was detected using TUNEL assay. Expression patterns of genes ATG8 and ATG12, which were used as indicators of autophagy, and genes of the ecdysoneregulated gene cascade were examined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Fenoxycarb application on day 0 of the 5th larval instar extended the feeding period and postponed programmed cell death in mature larval midgut. This effect was probably due to a delay in ecdysone secretion and associated changes in gene expression were mostly not a direct response to the fenoxycarb. However, differences in the gene expression patterns in the control and fenoxycarb treated insects during the prepupal and early pupal stages indicated that fenoxycarb may also exert a more direct effect on some genes of the ecdysone regulated gene cascade. \u00a9 Institute of Entomology, Biology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice."

            "text": "Background: The accurate monitoring and evaluation of malaria vectors requires efficient sampling. The objective of this study was to compare methods for sampling outdoor-biting Anopheles mosquitoes in Cambodia. Methods: In the Cambodian provinces of Pursat, Preah Vihear, and Ratanakiri, six different mosquito trapping methods were evaluated: human landing collection (HLC), human-baited tent (HBT), cow-baited tent (CBT), CDC miniature light trap (LT), CDC miniature light trap baited with molasses and yeast (LT-M), and barrier fence (F) in a Latin square design during four or six consecutive nights at the height of the malaria transmission season. Results: Using all traps, a total of 507, 1175, and 615 anophelines were collected in Pursat, Preah Vihear, and Ratanakiri, respectively. CBTs captured 10- to 20-fold more anophelines per night than the other five sampling methods. All 2297 Anopheles mosquitoes were morphologically identified and molecularly typed using standard morphological keys and sequencing the rDNA ITS2 region to distinguish cryptic species, respectively. Overall, an extremely diverse set of 27 known Anopheles species was sampled. CBTs captured the same molecular species that HLCs and the other four traps did, as well as additional species. Nine specimens representing five Anopheles species (Anopheles hyrcanus, Anopheles barbirostris sensu stricto, Anopheles barbirostris clade III, Anopheles nivipes, and Anopheles peditaeniatus) were infected with Plasmodium falciparum and were exclusively captured in CBTs. Conclusions: These data indicate that cow-baited tents are highly effective in sampling diverse Anopheles malaria vectors in Cambodia. This sampling method captured high numbers of anophelines with limited sampling effort and greatly reduced human exposure to mosquito bites compared to the gold-standard human landing collection. \u00a9 2016 The Author(s)."

We combined entomological surveys, movement simulations of air-borne particles, and population genetics to reconstruct the chain of events that led to a newly colonized French area nestled at the northern foot of the Pyrenees. Simulating the movement of air-borne particles evidenced frequent wind-transport events allowing, within at most 36 hours, the immigration of midges from north-eastern Spain and Balearic Islands, and, as rare events, their immigration from Corsica. Completing the puzzle, population genetic analyses discriminated Corsica as the origin of the new population and identified two successive colonization events within west-Mediterranean basin. Our findings are of considerable importance when trying to understand the invasion of new territories by expanding species."

Armigeres subalbatus (Diptera: Culicidae) were nine times more likely to be found in latrines (mean catch: 3.09) than in adjacent bedrooms (mean catch: 0.37) [odds ratio (OR) 9.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.74-15.11] and mosquitoes were active in and around 59% of latrines at dusk. Armigeres subalbatus was strongly associated with latrines with damaged or improperly sealed septic tank covers (OR 5.44, 95% CI 2.02-14.67; P < 0.001). Armigeres subalbatus is a nuisance biter and a putative vector of Japanese encephalitis and dengue viruses. Dengue virus serotype 3 was identified from a single pool of non-blood-fed female A. subalbatus using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Maintaining a good seal around septic tanks by covering them with a layer of soil is a simple intervention to block mosquito exit/entry and contribute to vector control in resettlement villages. The scale-up of this simple, cheap intervention would have global impact in preventing the colonization of septic tanks by nuisance biting and disease-transmitting mosquitoes. \u00a9 2016 The Royal Entomological Society."

It also proposes viable methods of implementing these policies in Cambodia. Currently, a wide range of malaria research is being conducted by in-country stakeholders, including Cambodia's National Programme for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control's (CNM), non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions. Coordinating research amongst these partners, as well as within the Ministry of Health, is a challenge. Results are rarely disseminated widely and seldom inform programme and policy decisions. CNM and its research partners have severely limited access to each other's databases. This lack of accessibility, timeliness, engagement and cooperation between CNM and its partners greatly impacts overall research efficiency in this field, and is stifling innovation both within and beyond CNM. Cambodia has set a goal to eradicate all forms of malaria by 2030. As countries approach the elimination phase, there is a greater need for sharing research-generated evidence amongst partners, in order to ensure that appropriate and impactful activities are conducted. The Cambodian Research Consortium was established to serve as a framework for partners, stakeholders and researchers to share research projects, information and results, and to promote the goals of CNM. The sharing of malaria research results will help to inform prevention, control and elimination activities in the country. It will also determine and address the country's operational research needs, and could potentially become a framework model to be used in other countries aiming to transition from malaria control to elimination. \u00a9 2015 Canavati et al."

Despite the importance of honey storage for colony survival, very little is known about decision making by honey bee workers that could optimise the transformation of nectar into honey. Here we test, using diagnostic radioentomology, whether workers use rules based on sugar concentration to optimise the spatial distribution of storage cells during nectar ripening. The data show that after the first 3\u00a0days of storing activity, various sugar concentrations were mixed in individual cells. A spatial clustering of cells with content of similar concentration was only occasionally observed. The results, therefore, suggest that at early stages of storage, spatial proximity of cells with similar sugar concentrations does not result in improved efficiency and, therefore, does not seem adaptive. The costs involved in locating particular cells probably outweighs the benefits of clustering. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, physiological constraints (e.g. variation in the perception of sugar concentration) might limit such optimisation behaviour. Storing behaviour can serve as a model to better understand food provisioning and complex organisation of insect societies. \u00a9 2015, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI)."

            "text": "Biosystematics and conservation biology are critical scientific disciplines that underpin the management of biological diversity. This is because biosystematics provides two basic elements that are fundamental to conservation management: the circumscription of species and the spatial distribution of species. These elements in turn allow conservation biologists to determine the components of biodiversity, such as local species richness (\u03b1-diversity), composition and community structure, patterns of spatial turnover and heterogeneity (\u03b2-diversity), levels of endemism, and location of 'biodiversity hotspots'. This information ultimately provides a framework for systematic conservation planning for the management of biological diversity and natural resources. In this review, drawing on examples of Australian diurnal Lepidoptera (butterflies and day-flying moths), we discuss three areas of conservation biology that are crucial for insect biodiversity conservation: (1) inventory and estimation of faunal richness; (2) monitoring for conservation management and the selection and use of bioindicators; and (3) assessment of conservation status and recovery of threatened species. We then explore the capacity of biosystematics to complement and enhance these programmes. Major challenges for biosystematics are to catalogue and map the Earth's known species, to discover and describe new or as-yet-unknown species, to reconstruct the evolutionary history or tree of life and to incorporate phylogenetic diversity (taxonomic distinctiveness) as a component of biodiversity into conservation planning and practical nature conservation. The first two tasks, which need to be completed relatively urgently in an era of biodiversity crisis and a limited and declining pool of taxonomic expertise, are required in order to optimise conservation effort of the world's biodiversity. It is recommended that to overcome the taxonomic impediment for insect conservation taxonomic attention should focus on a limited set of 'priority' taxa, and the rate at which new species are discovered and described needs to be accelerated (by at least an order of magnitude). An agenda for future research in biosystematics and conservation biology is proposed as a guideline for biodiversity conservation for Australian entomology. \u00a9 2015 Australian Entomological Society."

Three pig hooves were each subjected to a blow with a small cleaver and a cut with a razor blade prior to insect exposure. We used Dermestes maculatus DeGeer 1774 species. These beetles made principally depressions and destruction on both wounds, and bites were observed on the edges of the wounds. As time passed and insects fed and refuge, chop marks were deformed and disappeared, taking this less than a month. Thus, D. maculatus could mask postmortem wounds and probably premortem wounds, and so the cause of death. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved."

Food authentication, monitoring illegal trade in endangered species, forensic entomology, sexual assault case work and counter terrorism are just some of the fields that can require the detection of the biological species present. Traditional laboratory based approaches employ a wide variety of tools and technologies and exploit a number of different species specific traits including morphology, molecular differences and immuno-chemical analyses. A large number of these approaches require laboratory based apparatus and results can take a number of days to be returned to investigating authorities. Having a presumptive test for rapid identification could lead to savings in terms of cost and time and allow sample prioritisation if confirmatory testing in a laboratory is required later. This model study describes the development of an assay using a single HyBeacon\u00ae probe and melt curve analyses allowing rapid screening and authentication of food products labelled as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Exploiting melt curve detection of species specific SNP sites on the COI gene the test allows detection of a target species (Atlantic cod) and closely related species which may be used as substitutes. The assay has been designed for use with the Field Portable ParaDNA system, a molecular detection platform for non-expert users. The entire process from sampling to result takes approximately 75 min. Validation studies were performed on both single source genomic DNA, mixed genomic DNA and commercial samples. Data suggests the assay has a lower limit of detection of 31 pg DNA. The specificity of the assay to Atlantic cod was measured by testing highly processed food samples including frozen, defrosted and cooked fish fillets as well as fish fingers, battered fish fillet and fish pie. Ninety-six (92.7%) of all Atlantic cod food products, tested, provided a correct single species result with the remaining samples erroneously identified as containing non-target species. The data shows that the assay was quick to design and characterise and is also capable of yielding results that would be beneficial in a variety of fields, not least the authentication of food. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

            "text": "Background: Choice egg-count bioassays are a popular tool for analysing oviposition substrate preferences of gravid mosquitoes. This study aimed at improving the design of two-choice experiments for measuring oviposition substrates preferences of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae senso lato, a mosquito that lays single eggs. Methods: In order to achieve high egg-laying success of female An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes in experiments, four factors were evaluated: (1) the time provided for mating; (2) the impact of cage size, mosquito age and female body size on insemination; (3) the peak oviposition time; and, (4) the host sources of blood meal. Choice bioassays, with one mosquito released in each cage containing two oviposition cups both with the same oviposition substrate (100 ml water), were used to measure and adjust for egg-laying characteristics of the species. Based on these characteristics an improved design for the egg-count bioassay is proposed. Results: High oviposition rates [84%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 77-89%] were achieved when 300 male and 300 blood-fed female An. gambiae s.s. were held together in a cage for 4 days. The chances for oviposition dropped (odds ratio 0.30; 95% CI 0.14-0.66) when human host source of blood meal was substituted with a rabbit but egg numbers per female were not affected. The number of eggs laid by individual mosquitoes was overdispersed (median = 52, eggs, interquartile range 1-214) and the numbers of eggs laid differed widely between replicates, leading to a highly heterogeneous variance between groups and/or rounds of experiments. Moreover, one-third of mosquitoes laid eggs unequally in both cups with similar substrates giving the illusion of choice. Sample size estimations illustrate that it takes 165 individual mosquitoes to power bioassays sufficiently (power = 0.8, p = 0.05) to detect a 15% shift in comparative preferences of two treatments. Conclusion: Two-choice egg count bioassays with Anopheles are best done with a two-tier design that (1) implements a parallel series of experiments with mosquitoes given a choice of two identical substrates choices and, (2) uses a single mosquito in each test cage rather than groups of mosquitoes to assess the preference of a test or control solution. This approach, with sufficient replication, lowers the risk detecting pseudopreferences. \u00a9 2015 Okal et al."

Screening by vector dissection is a tiresome technique. We aimed to screen filarial parasites in their vectors by single and multiplex PCR and evaluate the usefulness of multiplex PCR as a rap\u00adid xenomonitoring and simultaneous differentiation tool, in area where 3 filarial parasites are coexisting. Female mosquitoes were collected from 7 localities in Assiut Governorate, were microscopically identified and divided into pools according to their species and collection site. Detection of W. bancrofti, D. immitis, and D. repens using single PCR was reached followed by multiplex PCR. Usefulness of multiplex PCR was evaluated by testing mosquito pools to know which genera and species are used by filarial parasites as a vector. An overall estimated rate of infection (ERI) in mosquitoes was 0.6%; the highest was Culex spp. (0.47%). W. bancrofti, D. immitis, and D. repens could be simultaneously and differentially detected in infected vectors by using multiplex PCR. Out of 100 mosquito pools, 8 were positive for W. bancrofti (ERI of 0.33%) and 3 pools each were positive for D. immitis and D. repens (ERI 0.12%). The technique showed 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity. El-Nikhila, El-Matiaa villages, and Sahel Seleem district in Assiut Governorate, Egypt are still endemic foci for filarial parasites. Multiplex PCR offers a reliable procedure for molecular xenomonitoring of filariasis within their respective vectors in endemic areas. Therefore, it is recommended for evaluation of mosquito infection after lymphatic filariasis eradication programs. \u00a9 2015, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine."

A baseline entomology survey was conducted in Asutifi and Tano (referred to as Ahafo) in the Brong-Ahafo geo-political region of Ghana during preparatory stages for mining by Newmont Ghana Gold Limited. Methods: Between November 2006 and August 2007, eight Centre for Disease Control light traps were set daily (Monday-Friday) to collect mosquitoes. Traps were hanged in rooms that were selected from a pool of 1,100 randomly selected houses. Types of materials used in construction of houses were recorded and mosquito prevention measures were assessed from occupants. Results: A total of 5,393 mosquitoes were caught that comprised Anopheles gambiae (64.8%), Anopheles funestus (4.2%), as well as Culicines, comprising of Culex (30.4%) and Aedes species (0.6%). The entomological inoculation rate in Asutifi (279 infective bites/person/month) and Tano (487 infective bites/person/month) demonstrate relatively high malaria transmission in Ahafo. The presence or absence of Anopheles vectors in rooms was influenced by the type of roofing material (OR 2.33, 95%CI: 1.29-4.22, p\u2208=\u22080.01) as well as the presence of eaves gaps (OR 1.80, 95%CI: 1.37-2.37, p\u2208<\u22080.01). It was also associated with bed net availability in the room (OR 1.39, 95%CI: 1.08-1.80, p\u2208=\u22080.01). Over 80% of the houses were roofed with corrugated zinc sheets. Over 60% of the houses in Ahafo had no eaves gaps to give access to mosquito entry and exit into rooms and mosquito bed net coverage was over 50%. Other measures used in preventing mosquito bites included; coil (22.1%), insecticide spray (9.4%), repellent cream (4.0%) and smoky fires (1.1%), contributed minimally to individual mosquito preventive measures in impact areas. Similarly, levels of protection; coil (16.9%), insecticide spray (2.8%) and repellent cream (0.3%) for the non-impact areas, depict low individual prevention measures. Conclusions: The survey identified areas where intensified vector control activities would be beneficial. It also demonstrates that transmission in Asutifi and Tano is high even before the commencement of mining operations. This study serves as baseline information to assess impact of mining activities in relation to future vector control interventions. \u00a9 2015 Dery et al.; licensee BioMed Central."

Out of about 340 known species, only 22 species belonging to 7 genera have to date been cytogenetically analysed. In the present study, the chromosome complement and meiotic details of one species, Odontopus nigricornis St\u00e5l has been revised, whilst that of another species, Antilochus russus St\u00e5l has been cytogenetically analyzed for the first time. The diploid chromosome complement of O. nigricornis is 2n (\u2642) = 25 = 22A + X1X2X30; the first time this particular multiple sex chromosome system has been reported in the Pyrrhocoridae. Three sex chromosomes mostly remain intimately associated during male meiosis and their number was confirmed at diplotene and anaphase II, where they dissociate slightly to become distinct. Meiosis is post-reductional for sex chromosomes. However, unlike other pyrrhocorids with multiple X chromosomes, the X1, X2 and X3 lie outside the autosomal ring on the metaphase plate during both divisions. The male diploid chromosome complement of A. russus was found to be 2n = 27 = 26A + X0. Apart from the typical meiotic features of heteropterans, the latter species shows inter- and intra-population variations in frequency of ring bivalents."

Sarcophagidae and Calliphoridae species were present in 75% of the cases with Lucilia sericata and Chrysomya albiceps collected in 50% of the cases. Chrysomya albiceps was always found in association with Lucilia species. Scuttle flies (Phoridae) were found in 37.5% of the cases, confirming the ability of these species in indoor body colonization.

The metabolomic approach has been employed in some, but not many, insect study systems, starting in 1990 with the evaluation of the metabolic effects of parasitism on moth larvae. Metabolomics has now been applied to a variety of aspects of insect biology, including behaviour, infection, temperature stress responses, CO2 sedation, and bacteria-insect symbiosis. From a technical and reporting standpoint, these studies have adopted a range of approaches utilising established experimental methodologies. Here, we review current literature and evaluate the metabolomic approaches typically utilised by entomologists. We suggest that improvements can be made in several areas, including sampling procedures, the reduction in sampling and equipment variation, the use of sample extracts, statistical analyses, confirmation, and metabolite identification. Overall, it is clear that metabolomics can identify correlations between phenotypic states and underlying cellular metabolism that previous, more targeted, approaches are incapable of measuring. The unique combination of untargeted global analyses with high-resolution quantitative analyses results in a tool with great potential for future entomological investigations. \u00a9 2015 The Netherlands Entomological Society."

Objective: This study evaluates the current entomological indices of triatomines responsible for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Sucre State, Venezuela. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional and prospective study was conducted in 95 towns and 577 dwellings in the 15 municipalities of the state of Sucre, Venezuela, from August to November, 2008. Triatomine bugs were identified on the basis of morphological characteristics, and their feces examined for T. cruzi infection through direct microscopy. Positive slides were stained with Giemsa and parasites were identified by morphologic characterization. Results: The entomological indices expressing the highest values were dispersion (16.67%) and household colonization (33.33%). The triatomine species captured were: Rhodnius prolixus, Rhodnius pictipes, Rhodnius robustus, Panstrongylus geniculatus, and Triatoma maculata, the latter being the main intradomiciliaryvector. Conclusions: Despite the low index of vector infection (1.72%), the existence of species with domiciliary and peridomiciliary reproductive success ensures the persistence of the epidemiological chain both for the disease and the parasite."

About the applicability of regression models, the problem of multicollinearity results mainly in increased standard error, thus, the Student's t-value is reduced, affecting the inferential results. Many actions are proposed in the literature to solve the problems of multicollinearity, however, the performance of these measurements are subject to the degree that multicollinearity of the variables may present, as well as the sample size. To address this problem, this paper aims to evaluate some ridge estimators using the Monte Carlo's simulation and demonstrate their application using real data from an entomological experiment. The ridge estimators evaluated were effective, in comparison with the least squares estimator. The results showed that the ridge estimators evaluated can be applied to experimenst that consider the variables with different degrees of multicollinearity, for samples greater than n=50."

            "text": "Background: Electric nets (e-nets) are used to analyse the flight behaviour of insects and have been used extensively to study the host-oriented flight of tsetse flies. Recently we adapted this tool to analyse the oviposition behaviour of gravid malaria vectors, Anopheles gambiae s.s., orienting towards aquatic habitats and traps by surrounding an artificial pond with e-nets and collecting electrocuted mosquitoes on sticky boards on the ground next to the nets. Here we study whether e-nets themselves affect the responses of gravid An. gambiae s.s. Methods. Dual-choice experiments were carried out in 80 m2 screened semi-field systems where 200 gravid An. gambiae s.s. were released each night for 12 nights per experiment. The numbers of mosquito landing on or approaching an oviposition site were studied by adding detergent to the water in an artificial pond or surrounding the pond with a square of e-nets. We also assessed whether the supporting framework of the nets or the sticky boards used to retain electrocuted mosquitoes influenced the catch. Results: Two similar detergent treated ponds presented in choice tests caught an equal proportion of the mosquitoes released, whereas a pond surrounded by e-nets caught a higher proportion than an open pond (odds ratio (OR) 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 - 2.7; p < 0.017). The separate evaluation of the impact of the square of electric nets and the yellow boards on the approach of gravid females towards a pond suggests that the tower-like construction of the square of electric nets did not restrict the approach of females but the yellow sticky boards on the ground attract gravid females to a source of water (OR 2.7 95% CI 1.7 - 4.3; p < 0.001). Conclusion: The trapping efficiency of the electric nets is increased when large yellow sticky boards are placed on the ground next to the e-nets to collect electrocuted mosquitoes, possibly because of increased visual contrast to the aquatic habitat. It is therefore important when comparing two treatments that the same trapping device is used in both. The importance of contrast around artificial habitats might be exploited to improve collections of An. gambiae s.s. in gravid traps. \u00a9 2014 Dugassa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

This study was designed to investigate if the expansion of irrigation influences the abundance of sand fly species potentially involved in the transmission of HVL and SCL located in arid bioclimatic regions. Geographic and remote sensing approaches were used to predict the density of visceral leishmaniasis vectors in Tunisia. Entomological investigations were performed in the governorate of Sidi Bouzid, located in the arid bioclimatic region of Tunisia. In 2012, sand flies were collected by CDC light traps located at nine irrigated and nine non-irrigated sites to determine species abundance. Eight species in two genera were collected. Among sand flies of the subgenus Larroussius, P. perfiliewi was the only species collected significantly more in irrigated areas. Trap data were then used to develop Poisson regression models to map the apparent density of important sand fly species as a function of different environmental covariates including climate and vegetation density. The density of P. perfiliewi is predicted to be moderately high in the arid regions. These results highlight that the abundance of P. perfiliewi is associated with the development of irrigated areas and suggests that the expansion of this species will continue to more arid areas of the country as irrigation sites continue to be developed in the region. The continued increase in irrigated areas in the Middle East and North Africa region deserves attention, as it is associated with the spread of L. infantum vector P. perfiliewi. Integrated vector management strategies targeting irrigation structures to reduce sand fly vector populations should be evaluated in light of these findings. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V."

Blood with high levels of heparin (10%) was unsuitable for artificial colony rearing, whereas bed bugs fed on 1% heparinized blood and those that naturally ingested rat blood completed their lifecycle with similar stage structures over time, with no significant differences in mortality. No differences in feeding efficiency or fertility were found in a direct comparison of bed bugs maintained under each of these two treatments, but analysis of the full lifecycle revealed that artificially fed bed bugs became significantly smaller and laid fewer eggs than rodent-fed bed bugs. The level of membrane stretching regulated the number of bed bugs that fed. When the membrane was stretched to twice its length and width, 96% of bed bugs successfully fed through the parafilm. Whole heparinized blood that was stored at 6\u00b0C for \u226514days failed to retain its nutritional value and the amount of blood consumed and number of consecutive moults were significantly reduced. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Entomological Society."

            "text": "Background: The economic burden of diseases has become increasingly relevant to policy makers as healthcare expenditure keep rising in the face of limited and competing resources. Buruli ulcer (BU), a neglected but treatable tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, the only known environmental mycobacterium is capable of causing long term disability when left untreated. However, most BU studies have tended to focused on its bacteriology, epidemiology, entomology and other social determinants to the neglect of its economic evaluation. This paper reports estimated the household economic costs of BU and describe the intangible cost suffered by BU patients in an endemic area. Methods. Retrospective one year cost data was used. A total of 63 confirmed BU cases were randomly sampled for the study. Economic cost and cost burden of BU were estimated. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the cost estimates. Intangible cost measured stigmatization, pain, functional limitation and social isolation of children. Results: The annual total household economic cost was US$35,915.98, of which about 65% was cost incurred by children with a mean cost of US$521.04. The mean annual household cost was US$570.09. The direct cost was 96% of the total cost. Non-medical cost accounts for about 97% of the direct cost with a mean cost of US$529.27. The mean medical cost was US$18.94. The main cost drivers of the household costs were transportation (78%) and food (12%). Caregivers and adult patients lost a total of 535 productive days seeking care, which gives an indirect cost valued at US$1,378.67 with a mean of US$21.88. A total of 365 school days (about 1 year) were lost by 19 BU patients (mean, 19.2 days). Functional loss and pain were low, and stigma rated moderate. Most children suffering from BU (84%) were socially isolated. Conclusion: Household cost burden of out-patient BU ulcer treatment was high. Household cost of BU is therefore essential in the design of its intervention. BU afflicted children experience social isolation. \u00a9 2013 Amoakoh and Aikins; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Animals in noise-polluted habitats typically adjust their signals away from high background noise levels to ensure successful signal transmission under challenging environmental conditions. Earlier we demonstrated that male Chorthippus biguttulus grasshoppers from roadside habitats produce courtship signals with elevated frequency components compared to conspecifics from non-roadside habitats. Here, we use a common garden approach to study the mechanisms underlying this response. We transferred grasshopper nymphs from seven roadside as well as five non-roadside habitats to the laboratory to rear half of them under noisy and the other half under quiet conditions in a full factorial two-by-two design. Courtship songs of adult males were later recorded under standardized quiet conditions. Males exposed to road noise as nymphs produced signals with higher frequency components compared to males reared under quiet conditions, indicating developmental plasticity as a mechanism underlying the signal adjustment to anthropogenic noise in grasshoppers. In addition, males originating from roadside habitats produced signals with higher frequency components and an increased syllable to pause ratio - a sexually selected signal trait - compared to males from non-roadside habitats. Our results demonstrate for the first time that developmental plasticity may play an important role in song trait modifications in response to anthropogenic noise. Furthermore, they suggest that multiple roadside populations may have diverged in parallel, possibly in response to selection for minimizing signal masking by road noise. \u00a9 2013 British Ecological Society."

            "text": "Background: The Pleistocene climatic oscillations are considered as a major driving force of intraspecific divergence and speciation. During Ice Ages, populations isolated in allopatric glacial refugia can experience differentiation in reproductive traits through divergence in selection regimes. This phenomenon may lead to reproductive isolation and dramatically accentuates the consequences of the climatic oscillations on species. Alternatively, when reproductive isolation is incomplete and populations are expanding again, further mating between the formerly isolated populations can result in the formation of a hybrid zone, genetic introgression or reinforcement speciation through reproductive trait displacements. Therefore changes in reproductive traits driven by population movements during climatic oscillations can act as an important force in promoting pre-zygotic isolation. Notwithstanding, divergence of reproductive traits has not been approached in the context of climatic oscillations. Here we investigate the impact of population movements driven by climatic oscillations on a reproductive trait of a bumblebee species (Bombus lapidarius). We characterise the pattern of variation and differentiation across the species distribution (i) with five genes (nuclear and mitochondrial), and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees. Results: Our results provide evidence that populations have experienced a genetic allopatric differentiation, in at least three main refugia (the Balkans, Centre-Eastern Europe, and Southern Italy) during Quaternary glaciations. The comparative chemical analyses show that populations from the Southern Italian refugium have experienced MMS differentiation and an incipient speciation process from another refugium. The meeting of Southern Italian populations with other populations as a result of range expansion at a secondary contact zone seems to have led to a reinforcement process on local MMS patterns. Conclusions: This study suggests that population movement during Quaternary climatic oscillations can lead to divergence in reproductive traits by allopatric differentiation during Ice Ages and by reinforcement during post-glacial recolonization. \u00a9 2013 Lecocq et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The objective of the present study was to develop a new trap for the collection of Anopheles darlingi. The initial trials were conducted using the BG-Sentinel trap as a standard for further trap development based on colour, airflow direction and illumination. The performance of the trap was then compared with those of the CDC, Fay-Prince, counterflow geometry trap (CFG) and HLC. All trials were conducted outdoors between 06:00 pm-08:00 pm. Female specimens of An. darlingi were dissected to determine their parity. A total of 8,334 anophelines were captured, of which 4,945 were identified as An. darlingi. The best trap configuration was an all-white version, with an upward airflow and no required light source. This configuration was subsequently named BG-Malaria (BGM). The BGM captured significantly more anophelines than any of the other traps tested and was similar to HLC with respect to the number and parity of anophelines. The BGM trap can be used as an alternative to HLC for collecting anophelines."

Since establishing in the United States, this invasive species has caused significant economic losses in agriculture and created major nuisance problems for home and business owners, especially in the mid-Atlantic region. Basic and applied questions on H. halys have been addressed in its native range in Asia since the mid-1900s and the research outcomes have been published in at least 216 articles from China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. In Asia, H. halys is described as an occasional or outbreak pest of a number of crops such as apple, pear, persimmon, and soybeans. This species is considered a nuisance pest as well, particularly in Japan. This review summarizes 100 articles primarily translated from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to English. The content of this review focuses on the biology, ecology, and management of H. halys in Asia, with specific emphasis on nomenclature, life history, host range, damage, economic importance, sampling and monitoring tools, and management strategies. This information from the native range of H. halys provides greater context and understanding of its biology, ecology, and management in North America. \u00a9 2013 Entomological Society of America."

Limited genetic mapping data for organophosphate and pyrethroid resistance in heliothine and spodopteran pests generally agrees with this paradigm. However, other biochemical and transcriptomic data suggest a more complex set of changes in multiple P450 and esterase gene/enzyme systems in resistant strains of these species. We discuss possible explanations for this paradox, including the likely embedding of these genes in regulatory cascades and emerging evidence for their arrangement in large clusters of closely related genes. We conclude that there could indeed be an unusually large number of genetic options for evolving resistance in these species. \u00a9 2013 Society of Chemical Industry."

In addition to Pijnackeria hispanica, the tetraploid all-female type species, molecular, karyological and SEM investigations led to the recognition of four bisexual and one triploid unisexual new species. Bisexuals' karyotypes (2n = 37/38) differ for minute traits and the haploid set is repeated, with few differences, three or four times in the polyploids that appeared to be of hybrid origin. Diagnostic morphological traits were found among body size parameters, antennal articles, male cerci, ovipositor valve and egg chorionic features. All species commonly feed on the broom Sarothamnus scoparius, but habitat disturbance appeared to induce food plant shifts. Moreover, trends from bisexuality to unisexuality through spanandry, probably related to habitat disruption, have been witnessed. The diploid species (Pijnackeria lucianae, Pijnackeria barbarae, Pijnackeria lelongi and Pijnackeria originis) have small ranges, while the polyploid hybrids (Pijnackeria masettii and P. hispanica) spread through Spain and Southern France, featuring a clear geographic parthenogenesis scenario, by colonizing wide areas and likely displacing their ancestors, or even leading them to extinction. Cyclic climatic changes and natural or anthropic habitat fragmentation may have been also of relevance in shaping present-day distribution. \u00a9 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

Four different conditions were tested (14:10, 12:12 and 10:14 h L:D at 25 \u00b0C, and 10:14 h L:D at 20 \u00b0C), at 80 \u00b1 10% RH. The shortest nymph development time was recorded at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) (21.5 days) and the longest at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C) (42 days). The highest nymph mortality rate was recorded at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C) and the lowest at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) (84.5 vs. 24.2%). Newly emerged females reared at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) were heavier than those of the remaining treatments. Fresh body weight gain (mg) occurred only during the 1st week of adult life. Adult survivorship was highest at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C) and lowest at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C). Total longevity was shortest when adults were held at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) and longest at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C) (38.6 vs. 98.8 days). The maximum percentage of ovipositing females occurred at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) and the minimum at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C). Females maintained at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) and 12:12 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) produced similar and greater number of egg masses than females at 10:14 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) and 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C). The number of eggs/female was the greatest at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) and the lowest at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C) (196.2 vs. 21.7 eggs/\u2640). Egg viability was similar under different photophases at 25 \u00b0C, while significantly reduced at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C) (54 vs. 4.1%). The longest egg incubation period was recorded at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C) and the shortest at 14:10 h L:D (25 \u00b0C) (7 vs. 4.1 days). These laboratory results suggest that P. guildinii does not reproduce during the time its preferred host soybean is unavailable at latitude 30\u00b0-35\u00b0 S, which corresponds approximately to the conditions tested at 10:14 h L:D (20 \u00b0C)."

Whole plant egg and nymph counts were taken weekly for 3 wk after the introduction of whitefly adults. The study was repeated 3 times. Egg densities tended to be statistically higher at 14 DAT than 3 or 7 DAT in the zeta-cypermethrin/bifenthrin and pymetrozine treatments. The other materials demonstrated greater efficacy than zeta-cypermethrin/bifenthrin and pymetrozine on 14 DAT. Egg densities were very low in all insecticide treatments compared to untreated plants at 3 and 7 DAT. Egg densities on plants treated with cyazypyr, flupyradifurone, pyrifluquinazon, and sulfoxaflor were statistically similar within a given DAT interval for most trials. Treatment effects on nymph densities were similar to treatment effects on egg densities. Cyazypyr, flupyradifurone, pyrifluquinazon, and sulfoxaflor represent distinct modes of action, and should contribute to future integrated pest management and integrated resistance management plans for B. tabaci on tomato."

First, they can use the personal information they sample in their environment. Second, they can use the inadvertent social information provided by the behaviour of conspecifics or heterospecifics (i.e. public information). Currently, little is known about the interaction between genetic variation and the use of personal versus public information in natural populations. Here, we investigated whether a natural genetic polymorphism affects the use of personal versus public information in a spatial learning task in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that genetic variation at the foraging locus interacts with social context during spatial learning. While both allelic variants are able to use personal and public information to improve their navigation during 10 training trials, a probe trial revealed that individuals carrying the forR (rover) allele rely mainly on personal information, whereas individuals carrying the fors (sitter) allele either use or display more public information than rovers. Accordingly, transfer of social information is more important in groups of sitters than in groups of rovers. These results suggest that a positive feedback loop can occur between alleles promoting group living, such as fors, and the use and/or display of public information, ultimately providing the opportunity for the joint evolution of sociality and cultural traits. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

            "text": "Several synthetic substances are used in agricultural areas to combat insect pests; however, the indiscriminate use of these products may affect nontarget insects, such as bees. In Brazil, one of the most widely used insecticides is imidacloprid, which targets the nervous system of insects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the brain of the Africanized Apis mellifera. The organs of both control bees and bees exposed to insecticide were subjected to morphological, histochemical and immunocytochemical analysis after exposure to imidacloprid, respectively, for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. In mushroom bodies of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD50/10 and in optic lobes of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD 50/10, LD50/100, and LD50/50, we observed the presence of condensed cells. The Feulgen reaction revealed the presence of some cells with pyknotic nuclei, whereas Xylidine Ponceau stain revealed strongly stained cells. These characteristics can indicate the occurrence of cell death. Furthermore, cells in mushroom bodies of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD50/10 appeared to be swollen. Cell death was confirmed by immunocytochemical technique. Therefore, it was concluded that sublethal doses of imidacloprid have cytotoxic effects on exposed bee brains and that optic lobes are more sensitive to the insecticide than other regions of the brain. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The potential of gamma-irradiated males to spread a pathogenic strain of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Ascomycota: Clavicipitaceae) to control this pest was studied. First, the effects of gamma irradiation (15 and 25 Gy) on the mating success and performance of adult males irradiated at age one day were studied in the laboratory. Although male longevity decreased after irradiation (118.6 vs. 244.7 days for irradiated and control males, respectively) and their testes suffered from the treatment, fecundity of mated females did not depend on the irradiation status of the male (86.8\u00c2 \u00b1\u00c2 5.5 eggs in 15 days). However, egg hatching was significantly lower in couples with irradiated males (31.4% vs. 86.5% for irradiated and control couples, respectively), and this value decreased after a second mating (6.1% vs. 85.9%). Therefore, irradiation did not affect male sexual competiveness but sperm quality. Second, a semi-field assay was carried out to evaluate infestation in young Phoenix canariensis caused by different combinations of couples with irradiated and/or B. bassiana-challenged males. The number of immature stages found in infested palms was significantly higher when females mated with untreated males and lower when mated with irradiated males (either B. bassiana-infected or not). Some females from the fungus-challenged treatments showed post-mortem hyphal growth, and this horizontal transmission proves that irradiated males could act as a vector for B. bassiana and should be considered as a new method to improve the biological control of R. ferrugineus.

The analyses were based on 4172 records of hard ticks collected from wild and domestic tetrapods. Most tick species included in this study were associated with three to 20 host species. No tick species has been associated either with a single species or with a single genus of host. It was found that the number of host species is sensitive to sampling effort, but not the STD*. The most frequent values of STD* were between 2.5 and 3.5, which shows that the host species more frequently used by Neotropical hard tick species belong to different families or different orders. Immature stages tend to use a broader taxonomic range of hosts than adults, and the interpretation of both measures of host specificity used in this study led to the conclusion that the impact of non-endemic hosts does not alter the patterns of host specificity in Neotropical hard ticks. The index STD* showed that a high proportion of tick species has phylogenetically unrelated species as principal hosts. The conclusion reached in this work indicates that strict host specificity is not common among Neotropical hard ticks and suggests that the influence of tick ecology and evolution of habitat specificity, tick generation time, phenology, time spent off the host and the type of life-cycle could be more important than hosts species.

Examples, mainly derived from personal research (primarily on butterflies), are given as a starting point with the aim of outlining areas of research that are still poorly understood. These include: the role of the direction of change in photoperiod; the role of factors such as temperature and diet in modifying the photoperiodic responses; and the role of sex, parental effects and sex linkage on photoperiodic control. More generally, there is still a limited understanding of how external cues and physiological pathways regulating various traits are interconnected via gene action to form a co-adapted complete phenotype that is adaptive in the wild despite environmental fluctuation and change. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Entomological Society."

The constraint on fitness for genetically adapted populations that are exposed to a new temperature has been well studied, but the range of optimal temperatures and their effect on fitness has never been examined across the worldwide distribution of a plastic species. Here, we determined the optimum temperature range of 11 populations of the phenotypically plastic species Drosophila simulans. We measured the influence of temperature on eggs, larvae and adults at six temperatures that span the natural range the flies experience during their primary breeding season. We found no correlation between optimum temperature and native temperature, an effect that is not likely due to laboratory maintenance, suggesting that the species has not locally adapted to temperature. We also found that this species had equal survival and reproductive success at most of the temperatures and life stages that we tested, regardless of the native temperature where the flies originated. Thus, this genetically plastic species has an optimum fitness at a surprisingly wide range of temperatures, and is the first example of a cosmopolitan species exhibiting this large amount of plasticity across its sampling distribution. \u00a9 2013 British Ecological Society."

Recent genotyping of B. cockerelli collected during the 2011 potato growing season identified three psyllid haplotypes within the western and central United States according to their geographical regions: northwestern, western, and central. To understand potato psyllid population dynamics before the year 2011, high resolution melting analysis of the B. cockerelli mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I-like gene was used to identify the haplotypes of over 450 archived psyllids collected in the western and central United States between the years 1998 and 2010. Results show that the northwestern haplotype was present in Washington State as early as 1998 and has persisted in this region since that time. Likewise, psyllids of the western haplotype have also been present in Washington and Oregon before 2011. \u00a9 2013 Entomological Society of America."

Bovine meat 100 g and cat food 100 g were placed on traps which were put in cages hanged on the campus of Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine. The larvae developed in the bovine meat and in cat food were killed in boiling water. Species from Diptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera families were detected and families and species of the insects were determined. The number of adult insects and larvae demonstrated that the species preferred the bovine meat rather than cat food. Food preferences of insects feeding on cadavers are very important in forensic entomology. The insects in the present study opted for bovine meat instead of cat food. However, further experiments and observations are needed in order to confirm food preferences of the insect species likely to be used in solving judicial cases. \u00a9 Medwell Journals, 2012."

            "text": "Background: The overall insecticidal effect is a key measure used to evaluate public health pesticides for indoor use in experimental hut trials. It depends on the proportion of mosquitoes that are killed out of those that enter the treated hut, intrinsic mortality in the control hut, and the ratio of mosquitoes entering the treatment hut to those entering the control hut. This paper critically examines the way the effect is defined, and discusses how it can be used to infer effectiveness of intervention programmes. Findings. The overall insecticidal effect, as defined by the World Health Organization in 2006, can be negative when deterrence from entering the treated hut is high, even if all mosquitoes that enter are killed, wrongly suggesting that the insecticide enhances mosquito survival. Also in the absence of deterrence, even if the insecticide kills all mosquitoes in the treatment hut, the insecticidal effect is less than 100%, unless intrinsic mortality is nil. A proposed alternative definition for the measurement of the overall insecticidal effect has the desirable range of 0 to 1 (100%), provided mortality among non-repelled mosquitoes in the treated hut is less than the corresponding mortality in the control hut. This definition can be built upon to formulate the coverage-dependent insecticidal effectiveness of an intervention programme. Coverage-dependent population protection against feeding can be formulated similarly. Conclusions: This paper shows that the 2006 recommended quantity for measuring the overall insecticidal effect is problematic, and proposes an alternative quantity with more desirable properties. \u00a9 2012 Brit et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In order to define vector-free periods/areas and to assess the vectorial role of the various Culicoides species, a comprehensive knowledge on their spatio-temporal occurrence is required. Methods. Biting midges were monitored on farm sites with livestock in the defined climatic regions, including high altitudes, of Switzerland by overnight trapping at 12 locations once a week over three years using UV-light traps. Based on morphological features, they were separated into three groups (i.e. Obsoletus, Pulicaris, other Culicoides spp.), and identification to the species level was achieved by protein profiling using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Results: Around 550,000 biting midges in total were collected, revealing a dominance (82 to 99%) of the Obsoletus group species up to an altitude of 1,200 m and of the Pulicaris group species above 1,500 m (85% at the highest trapping site at 2,130 m). The maximum number of midges collected in a summer night (756 to 19,682) as well as the total number of midges caught over three years (from 6,933 to 149,439) varied highly among the sites, whereas the annual variation in total midge abundance at the locations was statistically insignificant. MALDI-TOF MS of 100 randomly selected individual biting midges per trapping site yielded high quality spectra for 1,187 of the 1,200 (98.9%) specimens of which 1,173 could be assigned to one of the 15 Culicoides species for which biomarker mass sets are available in the reference database. Conclusions: There are no biting midge-free zones in all of the agriculturally utilized areas (including alpine summer pastures) of Switzerland. Annual variations of midge numbers at the sampled locations were low, indicating that monitoring of midges should preferably be done by investigating a large number of sites for one season instead of few locations for extended periods of time. High throughput species identification of midges by MALDI-TOF MS is feasible, and this technique adds to other recently developed methods for the identification of midges (PCRs in various formats, interactive identification keys), facilitating epidemiological and biological in-depth studies of these important insects. \u00a9 2012 Kaufmann et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Two collections of rubber tree leaves were conducted on May 2nd and June 5th, 2010. Twenty-five plants were sampled at random. Three leaves were collected per plant, from the lower third of the crown. The samples were placed in paper bags, packed in an isothermal box chilled gel-based pulp plant (Gelo-X\u00ae), and transported to the Entomology Laboratory at Embrapa Amap\u00e1, in Macap\u00e1. The leaflets were examined under a stereomicroscope, and the mites found on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the leaves were collected with a stilet, mounted on microscope slides in Hoyer's medium, and later identified. We collected a total of 1,722 mites of 10 families: Acaridae, Cunaxidae, Eriophyidae, Iolinidae, Phytoseiidae, Stigmaeidae, Tarsonemidae, Tenuipalpidae, Tydeidae, and Winterschmidtiidae, in addition to unidentified species of the suborders Oribatida and Astigmatina. The family Phytoseiidae represented only 2.90% of specimens collected, but showed the highest species richness (5 species). The only representative of Tenuipalpidae was Tenuipalpus heveae Baker, 1945, but 81.13% of the mites collected in this study belonged to this species."

We grew brassica plants in several types of fertilizer, including those commonly used in conventional and sustainable farming systems, and an unfertilized control. The effects of fertilizer type on the performance of two aphid species and foliar glucosinolate content were investigated. Both aphid species performed poorly (with reduced fecundity) on the unfertilized treatment compared with those feeding on fertilized host plants. Brevicoryne brassicae, the brassica specialist, performed best on Brassica oleracea plants fertilized with an organic animal manure, with a 72% increase in fecundity and an 18% increase in intrinsic rate of increase compared with plants fertilized with ammonium nitrate. By contrast, the generalist Myzus persicae had an intrinsic rate of increase that was reduced by 15% on plants growing in the animal manure compared with those growing in ammonium nitrate. These results may explain earlier findings on the effects of fertilizer type on aphid populations in the field, and are discussed in the context of pest species' responses to sustainable and conventional agricultural systems. \u00a9 2012 The Authors.

The influence of temperature (20, 28, and 32\u00b0C) on abdominal vibration patterns of individual females and males, proportion of mated females, and responsivity of male to female vibrational signals was investigated. When female and male adults were observed individually, temperatures of 20 and 32\u00b0C inhibited abdominal vibration by both genders in terms of proportion of vibrating insects, time spent in vibration per insect, time spent per bout of vibration, or all of these; the effects were more pronounced at 32\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C especially in males at 32\u00b0C. Although not significantly different, male responsivity to vibrating female was relatively high at 28\u00b0C, lower at 32\u00b0C, and still lower at 20\u00b0C, and finally more males located females at 28\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C, which contributes to the higher proportion of mated females at 28\u00b0C than at 20 or 32\u00b0C. Our results indicate that temperatures of 20 and 32\u00b0C inhibit the production of abdominal vibration and, to some extent, reduce male responsivity to female vibrational signals, which may partially explain the frequent population outbreaks in N. lugens in the years with warm autumn. \u00a9 2012 Entomological Society of America."

            "text": "During the past decade a few artists and even fewer entomologists discovered flatbed scanning technology, using extreme resolution graphical arts scanners for acquiring high magnification digital images of plants, animals and inanimate objects. They are not just for trip receipts anymore. The special attributes of certain scanners, to image thick objects is discussed along with the technical features of the scanners including magnification, color depth and shadow detail. The work of pioneering scanner artist, Joseph Scheer from New York's Alfred University is highlighted. Representative flatbed-scanned images of moths are illustrated along with techniques to produce them. Collecting and preparing moths, and other objects, for scanning are described. Highlights of the Fulbright sabbatical year of professor Scheer in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico are presented, along with comments on moths in science, folklore, art and pop culture. The use of flatbed scanners is offered as a relatively new method for visualizing small objects while acquiring large files for creating archival inkjet prints for display and sale. \u00a9 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

This study was conducted to determine the knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles, dieldrin resistance alleles, and entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) of malaria vectors in lower Moshi irrigation schemes for the mitigation of disease transmission. Materials and Methods: The study was longitudinal design conducted for 14 months. Mosquitoes were collected fortnightly by using a CDC miniature light trap in 20 houses. Mosquitoes were identified morphologically in the field, of which 10% of this population was identified to species level by using molecular techniques. Samples from this study population were taken for kdr and resistance to dieldrin (rdl) genes detection. Results: A total of 6220 mosquitoes were collected by using a light trap, of which 86.0% (n=5350) were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and 14.0% (n=870) were Culex quinquefasciatus. Ten percent of the An. gambiae s.l. (n=535) collected were taken for species identification, of which 99.8% (n=534) were identified as An. arabiensis while 0.2% (n=1) were An. gambiae sensu stricto. Of the selected mosquitoes, 3.5% (n=19) were sporozoite positive. None of the mosquitoes tested had the kdr gene. The rdl resistant allele was detected at a frequency of 0.48 throughout the year. EIR was determined to be 0.54 ib/trap/year. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that the homozygous and the heterozygous resistance present in rdl genes demonstrated the effect of pesticide residues on resistance selection pressure in mosquitoes. A better insecticide usage protocol needs to be developed for farmers to use in order to avoid excessive use of pesticides.

Inventories on necrophagous insects carried out in Brazil encompass mostly species from the southeastern and central-western regions of the country. This review aims to produce the first checklist of necrophagous Diptera and Coleoptera species of forensic relevance in northeastern Brazil, an area that concentrates high rates of homicides. We performed a literature survey on scientific articles, theses and dissertations regarding necrophagous insect species in the region, and contacted scientists who develop research on forensic entomology. Fifty-two species of Diptera belonging to eight families with previous record of necrophagy were reported in the region: Sarcophagidae, Calliphoridae, Muscidae, Fanniidae, Piophilidae, Phoridae, Anthomyiidae and Stratiomyidae. Coleopteran species from six families of forensic relevance were registered, although taxonomical identification remained superficial. Bait traps were the most frequent methodology used, followed by collection on animal carcasses. Seven Dipteran species from two families were registered on human cadavers. All species had been previously reported in other Brazilian states and/or other countries, although none has been effectively used in legal procedures in the region. The status of research on forensic entomology in northeastern Brazil is incipient, and the checklist produced here contributes to the knowledge on the local diversity of necrophagous insects."

We report a new trap design and the capture of a specimen of a triatomine rarely found. Methods: Two luminous traps were installed in the city of Diamantina, State of Minas Gerais, and surveyed weekly for a year. Results: A Triatoma arthurneivai female and other triatomine bugs were caught. Conclusions: A new trap design may be used in triatomine bugs field captures, mainly in low density areas. We assume the center of endemism of Triatoma arthurneivai is the Espinha\u00e7o Mountain range."

            "text": "Background: Previous studies in Dakar have highlighted the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of Anopheles gambiae s.l. biting rates. In order to improve the knowledge of the determinants of malaria transmission in this city, the present study reports the results of an extensive entomological survey that was conducted in 45 areas in Dakar from 2007 to 2010. Methods. Water collections were monitored for the presence of anopheline larvae. Adult mosquitoes were sampled by human landing collection. Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozote (CSP) protein indexes were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the entomological inoculation rates were calculated. Results: The presence of anopheline larvae were recorded in 1,015 out of 2,683 observations made from 325 water collections. A water pH of equal to or above 8.0, a water temperature that was equal to or above 30\u00b0C, the absence of larvivorous fishes, the wet season, the presence of surface vegetation, the persistence of water and location in a slightly urbanised area were significantly associated with the presence of anopheline larvae and/or with a higher density of anopheline larvae. Most of the larval habitats were observed in public areas, i.e., freely accessible. A total of 496,310 adult mosquitoes were caught during 3096 person-nights, and 44967 of these specimens were identified as An.gambiae s.l. The mean An. gambiae s.l. human-biting rate ranged from 0.1 to 248.9 bites per person per night during the rainy season. Anopheles arabiensis (93.14%), Anopheles melas (6.83%) and An. gambiae s.s. M form (0.03%) were the three members of the An. gambiae complex. Fifty-two An. arabiensis and two An. melas specimens were CSP-positive, and the annual CSP index was 0.64% in 2007, 0.09% in 2008-2009 and 0.12% in 2009-2010. In the studied areas, the average EIR ranged from 0 to 17.6 infected bites per person during the entire transmission season. Conclusion: The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of An. gambiae s.l. larval density, adult human-biting rate (HBR) and malaria transmission in Dakar has been confirmed, and the environmental factors associated with this heterogeneity have been identified. These results pave the way for the creation of malaria risk maps and for a focused anti-vectorial control strategy. \u00a9 2011Gadiaga et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "Mosquito salivary proteins are involved in several biological processes that facilitate their blood feeding and have also been reported to elicit an IgG response in vertebrates. A growing number of studies have focused on this immunological response for its potential use as a biological marker of exposure to arthropod bites. As mosquito saliva collection is extremely laborious and inefficient, most research groups prefer to work on mosquito salivary glands (SGs). Thus, SG protein integrity is a critical factor in obtaining meaningful data from immunological and biochemical analysis. Current methodologies rely on an immediate freezing of SGs after their collection. However, the maintenance of samples in a frozen environment can be hard to achieve in field conditions. In this study, SG proteins from two mosquito species (Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae s.s.) stored in different media for 5 days at either +4\u00b0C or room temperature (RT) were evaluated at the quantitative (i.e., ELISA) and qualitative (i.e., SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting) levels. Our results indicated that PBS medium supplemented with an anti-protease cocktail seems to be the best buffer to preserve SG antigens for 5 days at +4\u00b0C for ELISA analysis. Conversely, cell-lysis buffer (Urea-Thiourea-CHAPS-Tris) was best at preventing protein degradation both at +4\u00b0C and RT for further qualitative analysis. These convenient storage methods provide an alternative to freezing and are expected to be applicable to other biological samples collected in the field. \u00a9 2011 Fontaine et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Gondwanamyces spp. are unusual members of this group that were first discovered in the flower heads of the primitive angiosperm genus Protea, that is mostly restricted to the Cape Floristic region of Africa. In this study, we present the discovery of the vectors of Gondwanamyces proteae in Protea repens infructescences, which were identified using PCR, direct isolation, and light microscopy. Gondwanamyces proteae DNA and ascospores were identified on diverse lineages of arthropods including beetles (Euderes lineicolis and Genuchus hottentottus), bugs (Oxycarenus maculates), a psocopteran species and five mite (Acari) species. Based on isolation frequency, however, a mite species in the genus Trichouropoda appears to be the most common vector of G. proteae. Gondwanamyces spores were frequently observed within pit mycangia at the base of the legs of these mites. Manipulative experiments demonstrated the ability of mites to carry viable G. proteae spores whilst in transit on the beetle G. hottentottus and that these mites are able to transfer G. proteae spores to uncolonised substrates in vitro. Interestingly, this same mite species has also been implicated as vector of Ophiostoma spores on P. repens and belongs to the same genus of mites that vector Ophiostoma spp. associated with pine-infesting bark beetles in the Northern Hemisphere. \u00a9 2011 The British Mycological Society."

Examples of such applications come from astronomy, biology, the web, and other domains. It is not unusual for these applications to involve numbers of time series in the order of hundreds of millions to billions. However, all relevant techniques that have been proposed in the literature so far have not considered any data collections much larger than one-million time series. In this paper, we describe iSAX 2.0, a data structure designed for indexing and mining truly massive collections of time series. We show that the main bottleneck in mining such massive datasets is the time taken to build the index, and we thus introduce a novel bulk loading mechanism, the first of this kind specifically tailored to a time series index. We show how our method allows mining on datasets that would otherwise be completely untenable, including the first published experiments to index one billion time series, and experiments in mining massive data from domains as diverse as entomology, DNA and web-scale image collections. \u00a9 2010 IEEE."

            "text": "A permanent snow cover for several months is typical for large parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Snow layers thicker than about 20 cm insulate the soil surface and stabilize the ground temperature close to 0\u00b0C. Many ground-living invertebrates are active at this temperature in the subnivean air space. From this \"base camp\", some invertebrates migrate upwards to use the snow as a substrate. The intranivean fauna consists of springtails (Collembola) and mites (Acari) that are small enough to move within the narrow pores between snow crystals. The supranivean fauna consists of various invertebrates that are active on the snow surface. Some of them are Collembola that have migrated through the snow layers. However, most of them are larger insects and spiders which migrate between the subnivean and supranivean habitats following air channels which are naturally created along tree stems, bushes etc. penetrating the snow. Likewise, certain Chironomidae and Plecoptera, hatching from winter-open rivers and brooks, are active on the snow surface. The supranivean arthropod fauna has the following characteristics: 1. It is a weather dependent assemblage of species, coming and going with changes in air temperature, cloud cover, and wind. Below ca. -6\u00b0C animals are absent, but at temperatures around or above zero, many groups can be simultaneously active on snow. 2. The snow surface fauna shows phenological changes throughout the winter, as certain species and groups are mainly active during certain months. 3. Some invertebrates are highly specialized and take advantage of the snow surface as an arena in their life cycle. Examples are Hypogastrura socialis (Collembola), and the two wingless insects Chionea sp. (Diptera: Limoniidae) and Boreus sp. (Mecoptera). They use the smooth snow surface for efficient migration. Chionea sp. and Boreus sp. lay their eggs during the snow-covered period, while H. socialis migrates to create new colonies. The cold tolerant spider Bolephthyphantes index is unique in constructing webs in small depressions on the snow, to catch migrating Collembola. Various adaptations for using the snow as a substrate are discussed. Besides physiological and morphological adaptations, snow surface arthropods show special behavioural adaptations. Most conspicuous is the ability of several Collembola species to navigate during migration, using the position of the sun for orientation. Furthermore, in Collembola and Mecoptera, jumping as an original mechanism to escape predators has independently evolved into a migrating mechanism. An evolutionary potential exists for more invertebrate groups to take advantage of snow as a substrate in their life cycle. For instance, several more cold tolerant spiders might evolve the ability to catch migrating Collembola on snow. \u00a9 2003 Institute of Entomology."

            "text": "This is the first study of the morphological and molecular variation in two peripheral populations of the butterfly Jutta Arctic, Oeneis jutta, a glacial relict species endangered by the fragmentation of its habitat in Poland. An analysis of the morphological characteristics indicates that both Polish populations are similar but differ significantly in some characteristics. Levels of genetic variation were assessed using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene fragments together with a segment of the mtDNA control region (CR) and a nuclear elongation factor-1\u03b1 (EF-1\u03b1) gene sequence. In addition, the pattern of molecular variation in specimens from eastern and northern Europe was examined. Interestingly, the analysis of variation in a 932-bp sequence of the nuclear EF-1\u03b1 gene in representatives of the populations studied revealed a relatively higher level of diversity than that of mitochondrial genes. There was evidence of divergence between the peripheral populations and lack of gene flow between them. The two closely situated populations had a high \u03a6ST value (0.69), which clearly indicates their isolation. These populations appear to be demographically independent breeding units, with distinctive allele frequencies and consequently should be recognized as separate units for management and conservation. The preliminary results are in accord with an a priori subdivision based on collection areas and suggest that habitat fragmentation has affected the genetic diversity and structure of these populations. \u00a9 2003 Institute of Entomology."

Aedes taeniorhynchus and Cx. quinquefasciatus were the species found most commonly feeding on the dogs. Filarial nematodes were observed by microscopy in nine of the mosquito species collected; however, third-instar larvae were only observed in Ae. taeniorhynchus and An. crucians. Of 76 Ae. taeniorhynchus specimens found positive for Dirofilaria sp. by dissection, 14 were confirmed to be positive for Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resulting infection rate for D. immitis confirmed by PCR (6.2%) is higher than any infection rate for Ae. taeniorhynchus previously reported from the Americas. \u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Anthropophilic arthropods like cockroaches (Blattodea), silverfish (Thysanura), house flies (Diptera) and house and dust mites (Acari) have moved their habitat inside human dwellings to become part of the human biocenose. These arthropods, however, do not directly depend on humans. Synanthropic insects like filth flies, biting midges, no-see-ums, punkies, mosquitoes (Diptera) feed off humans directly through blood sucking or off excrements and garbage produced by humans. Some of these insects have adopted an endophilic lifestyle entering our homes to feed and rest. Like some stored product pests, some of the hematophagous insect species have lost their natural or peridomestic habitat and have become entirely dependant on domestic harbourage and humans. Forensic implications can be found in any area of entomology or acarology associated with human habitation.

Ectoparasitic fungi of the order Laboulbeniales (Ascomycetes) infect arthropods and form thalli on the host's body surface. Although several studies report the incidence of infection of certain host species by these fungi, quantitative data on laboulbenialean fungus-host arthropod interactions at the host assemblage level are rarely reported. To clarify the effects of host habitats on infection by ectoparasitic fungi, the incidence of infection by fungi of the genus Laboulbenia (Laboulbeniales) of overwintering carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in three habitats, a riverside (reeds and vines), a secondary forest and farmland (rice and vegetable fields), were compared in central Japan. Of the 531 adults of 53 carabid species (nine subfamilies) collected in the three habitats, a Laboulbenia infection of one, five and one species of the carabid subfamilies Pterostichinae, Harpalinae and Callistinae, respectively, was detected. Three species of fungus were identified: L. coneglanensis, L. pseudomasei and L. fasciculate. The incidence of infection by Laboulbenia was higher in the riverside habitat (8.97% of individuals; 14/156) than in the forest (0.93%; 2/214) and farmland (0%; 0/161) habitats. Furthermore, the incidence of infection by Laboulbenia in the riverside habitat ranged from 0 to 33.3% and differed significantly in the ten microhabitats (riverbank, edge of track, tall reeds, kudzu vines, slope of a hollow, rotten wood, vine reeds, under stones, the shoulder of a terrace and marshy ground) where the carabid beetles overwintered. These results suggest that host habitats and microhabitats are closely associated with successful infection by laboulbenialean fungi. \u00a9 2003 Institute of Entomology."

The dataset comprises seven outgroup taxa, all eight extant genera and a number of extinct taxa that have been associated with Megalyridae, including two genera from Maimetshidae, whose affinity with Megalyridae is uncertain. Analytical results are unstable because some of the fossil taxa have many missing entries. The most stable results are produced when the maimetshid taxa and Cretodinapsis are excluded. When included, these taxa fall outside crown-group Megalyridae, the maimetshid taxa being the sister of Orthogonalys (Trigonalidae). Based on the results of our analyses, we synonymize the fossil genera Rubes Perrichot n.syn. and Ukrainosa Perrichot & Perkovsky n.syn. with Prodinapsis, creating the new combinations Prodinapsis bruesi. n.comb. and Prodinapsis prolata. n.comb. When comparing past and present distributions of Megalyridae with the results of the phylogenetic analyses, it is evident that the genera radiated in the Mesozoic, and that the family as a whole was much more widespread then. The present-day distribution is essentially relictual, with range contraction since the early Tertiary probably being the result of climate deterioration, which caused the disappearance of tropical forests throughout the Palaearctic. \u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Males of the first annual generation were larger and had larger sperm. Comparing individuals of two summer generations showed that adult males resulting from group bred, ad libitum fed larvae were larger but had smaller sperm than males resulting from singly kept, food deprived larvae. Thus, sperm size is not a simple function of body size. Instead, we suggest that sperm size modification was caused by varying rearing densities. Group bred individuals produced smaller sperm but transferred at higher rate. This indicates a trade-off between sperm number and sperm size as predicted by evolutionary models of sperm production. Given the strong influence of larval history in our present work, we recommend that future studies investigating the consequences of varying sperm competition risk or intensity on male gametic strategies should also control for larval history in order to avoid distorting effects. \u00a9 2003 Institute of Entomology."

            "text": "The relationships between predatory Heteroptera and their potential prey species were investigated during two crop seasons in an inter-mountain area close to the Pyrenees (Iberian Peninsula). Regression was used to analyze the potential numerical responses shown by heteropterans to aphids and other potential prey during alfalfa intercuts (the plant growth period between cuts) of high aphid occurrence. The most abundant heteropterans were Orius spp., Nabis spp. and mirids, and all were present in alfalfa stands throughout the season. Acyrthosiphon pisum was the prevalent species during the 2nd intercut, Therioaphis trifolii during the 4th and Aphis craccivora during the 5th. We performed simple regression analysis between the Orius sp., Nabis sp. and mirids and the prevalent aphid species, forward multiple regression analysis between heteropterans and all possible soft-bodied prey species; and both analyses for coccinellids, as relative aphid predator specialists. The heteropterans responded numerically to A. pisum but not to T. trifolii or A. craccivora. Heteropterans also showed numerical responses to other potential prey (leafhoppers, thrips, and other soft bodied prey) that remained at low densities throughout the season. All these preys may contribute to the presence of heteropterans in alfalfa stands throughout the season. The results suggest that heteropterans may contribute to reduce A. pisum, particularly at the beginning of the growing season, and on other potential pests when they invade or recolonize alfalfa, and may help to delay or prevent the build-up of these pest populations. \u00a9 2003 Institute of Entomology."

The study detected growing egg intake, with an average daily consumption of 11.06, 49.02, 122.7, 148.09 and 374.9 eggs, from the first to the fifth instars, respectively. A predatory capacity of fist-instar larvae of S. frugiperda increased in line with its development, with an increase of approximately 14.3 times from the first to the fifth instar, in the 10 days of consumption, whereas the fourth and fifth instars presented an average daily consumption of 25.5 and 26.6, respectively - higher as compared to other instars. The greatest consumption of second-instar larvae by the predator took place in the fourth and fifth instars, which featured an average daily consumption of 12.8 and 15.1, respectively. It appears that E. annulipes is a potential predator of eggs and larvae of S. frugiperda, with an adult consuming 1,481.2; 89.20 and 48.6 eggs and larvae of first- and second-instars, respectively, during the ten days of monitored consumption."

            "text": "In order to predict the potential agronomic scenarios of the future, the probable involvements of climatic changes on weed dynamics were analyzed. In this perspective the several climatic parameters were examined and overlapped to the biological characteristics of the different species to predict both: weed evolution and the sustainability of the relative management. Thermal and CO 2 increasing favour the weed ruderality in terms of seed quantity and velocity of seed set. In addition the increasing of stress factors (thermal, drought, UV-B, etc.) favour the de-specialization trend as typically occurs in the most persistent weeds. Adverse climatic dynamics, even due to events of opposite biological action (for example drought and flooding), appears to have a synergistic impact with the agronomic disturbances. Indeed these additive disturbances increase the selective pressure of the phytocoenoses and play a crucial role in the allowing survival only to the \"segetal\" weeds as well it occurs from the origin of agriculture. Consequently, the different degree of resilience induces a decreasing of the phytocoenoses complexity. This biodiversity reduction appears to increase the risk of exotic weed invasion overall regards to species from warmer and more arid environments (potentially even parasite species). Their invasivity could be increased by biotic or abiotic stress factors that are not present in their native environment. The fate of rare weeds appears to go to their extinction, overall if their dynamics is linked to fragile mutualistic interaction as it occurs in the case of entomogamous species. Indeed such simultaneous presence (flora and pollinator fauna) is mined by the progressive differences between photoperiod and thermoperiod and the consequent de-synchronization of their phenological phases. This virtual weed evolution through the increasing of the richness of self-and wind-pollinated weeds will involve both: 1) the agricultural landscape degradation; 2) a worse human health because of atmosphere rich of allergenic pollen. In conclusion, weed phytocoenoses appear to be less vulnerable of the relative crops to the climatic injuries. This higher crop vulnerability will increase the pesticides use as well as already predicted regards to entomologic and phytopatologic aspects. Finally, an agronomic strategy of the future was hypothized. This is based on the germplasm utilization of the wild types in order to increase the environmental crop plasticity in the predicted climatic scenarios."

Historically, red oak borer has existed throughout southeastern U.S. forests at relatively low population levels, but Arkansas infestation estimates in 2001 and 2003 reported much higher populations. Red oak borer has a two-year generation with adult emergence occurring synchronously only in odd numbered years. We report here results of whole-tree estimates of pre-emergent red oak borer population numbers from 7 stands in 2005 and 3 stands in 2003 and 2007 in the Ozark National Forest. Trees were felled at each sampling site, cut into 0.5 m sections, split on site with hydraulic log splitters, and a count of live red oak borers was recorded for each tree. In 2001 and 2003, red oak borer population estimates indicated emerging populations much higher than any previously reported. An exponential decrease during a single cohort between 2003 and 2005, and even lower populations in 2007 suggest that red oak borer populations have returned to historic densities."

However, over the last decade, this case has come under attack from those who oppose Darwinian evolution. Here, the main elements of the case are outlined and the reasons that the peppered moth case became the most cited example of Darwinian evolution in action are described. Four categories of criticism of the case are then evaluated. Criticisms of experimental work in the 1950s that centered on lack of knowledge of the behavior and ecology of the moth, poor experimental procedure, or artificiality in experiments have been addressed in subsequent work. Some criticisms of the work are shown to be the result of lack of understanding of evolutionary genetics and ecological entomology on the part of the critics. Accusations of data fudging and scientific fraud in the case are found to be vacuous. The conclusion from this analysis of criticisms of the case is that industrial melanism in the peppered moth is still one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action and that it should be taught as such in biology classes. \u00a9 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Land use influence on beetle abundance (trap catch) was assessed using a geographic information system. Trap catch was consistently high in some locations and low in others. In general, high trap catches occurred near agronomic land planted with corn or soybeans, which are both preferred hosts of adult beetles. Low trap catches generally occurred in areas lacking preferred host plants. The amount of agronomic land within 500 m of the traps was always positively correlated with trap catch. Average trap catches were highly correlated by location from year to year, indicating stability of the relative distribution of the beetles along the trap line. Because high trap catches consistently occurred in the same locations, it can be inferred that trapping can be an effective method to monitor Japanese beetle populations. Taking airport-owned agronomic land out of corn and soybean production near the cargo terminals may reduce beetle activity in these areas. \u00a9 2007 Entomological Society of America."

            "text": "One of the most compelling challenges for conservation biologists is the preservation of species with restricted ranges. Carabus olympiae Sella, 1855, a ground beetle species inhabiting two small areas in the western Italian Alps, is an example of a steno-endemic and endangered insect species. Despite the fact that this species is historically well known to professional and amateur entomologists, its autecology is virtually unknown. In the present study we used pitfall traps to study habitat selection and phenology, and radiotelemetry to measure differences in movement parameters between sexes, habitats and periods. Data from pitfall trapping suggested that C. olympiae actively selects both shrubberies (alpen rose Rhododendron ferrugineum and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus) and beech forests and avoids pastures, and that population size peaks in July. All radio-tagged individuals (n=21) moved without a preferred direction, and were more active at night than by day. Males covered greater distances and had more tortuous trajectories than females. Distances covered in forests and alpen rose shrubberies were not significantly different, but paths in beech forests were more convoluted than in shrubberies. The movement pattern observed fits the requirements of a typical \"olfactory-tactile\" insect predator that looks for prey by systematically exploring its territory. Movement parameters suggested that both beech forests and alpen rose shrubberies are suitable for this species and indicated that the spatial distribution of shrubs in shrubberies can constrain trajectories. The implications for conservation are: (i) any human intervention which results in enlargement of the present coverage of pastures should be controlled; (ii) forest management may be tolerated, with the condition that alpen rose shrubberies remain or develop after tree-cutting; (iii) once a shrubbery has established, it should be preserved through appropriate management."

Bibliometric: evaluations of undergraduate programs showed a better performance of the departments of Chemistry (P < 0.001) and Biology (P < 0.001) when compared to the departments of Physics and Mathematics and Psychology and Education. We also analyzed the scientific output of the six graduate programs of FFCLRP: Psychology, Psychobiology, Chemistry, Physics Applied to Medicine and Biology, Comparative Biology, and Entomology, The graduate program in Psychology presented a lower h-index (P < 0.001) and had fewer papers indexed by the ISI web of science (P < 0.001) when compared to the other graduate programs. The poorer performance of the Psychology program may be associated with the limited coverage by the Thompson Institute of Scientific Information database."

Its phylogenetic relationships are unclear, although it has been hypothesized to be related to Graphelmis Del\u00e8ve, 1968, a large genus widely distributed in the Oriental and East Palaearctic regions. In this paper the larva of H. opis Hinton, 1976 is described based on material collected in the Cameron Highlands (Malaysia) and the conspecificity with co-existing adults tested using sequences of one nuclear (5\u2032 end of 18S rRNA) and three mitochondrial gene fragments (5\u2032 end of the large ribosomal unit + tRNAleu + 5\u2032 end of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1; 5\u2032 end of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I; and a fragment of cytochrome b) with a total of ca. 2,600 bp. This is the first example of the use of molecular data to match different life stages within the family Elmidae. The larva of H. opis has a subcylindrical body typical of many other elmid genera; abdominal segments 1-7 with preserved pleura; and ninth segment with oval operculum. The last instar larvae have clearly visible prominent spiracles on mesothorax and abdominal segments 1-8. The phylogenetic position of Hedyselmis in relation to Graphelmis was investigated using molecular data for three species of Graphelmis plus a selection of other Elmidae genera. Hedyselmis opis is nested within Graphelmis, confirming their close relationship and suggesting that their status requires taxonomic revision. \u00a9 2003 Institute of Entomology."

            "text": "Despite the important roles played by insects in most ecosystems, surprisingly little is known about how anthropogenic pollutants or their mixtures interact to affect insect populations. The independent and joint actions of selenate and methylmercury on a ubiquitous insect detritivore, Megaselia scalaris (Loew), were determined in this study. Ovipositing females did not distinguish between untreated food sources and those contaminated with toxic concentrations of selenate, methylmercury, or both chemicals in combination. Even at the highest concentrations of pollutants, no negative effects were observed for the egg stage. However, larval survival was significantly decreased and development significantly prolonged by selenate and methylmercury individually at low or intermediate ecologically relevant treatment levels. Potentiation was strongly evident because mixtures containing concentrations as little as only 1% of the respective individual median lethal tolerances (LC50s) caused significantly more mortality and delayed larval development than would be expected from the responses selenate and methylmercury elicit individually. However, survival and pupal development was not affected at any rate tested. Female fecundity was significantly decreased by methylmercury but not by selenate or mixture treatments. The relative toxicity to M. scalaris of each of the individual and joint treatments was selenate (LC50 = 260 \u03bcg/g) < methylmercury (LC50 = 22 \u03bcg/g) < the mixture at approximately 5% of the LC50 concentration of each of the components (12 \u03bcg/g selenate plus 1.0 \u03bcg/g methylmercury). The increased mortality and delayed larval development within sites contaminated by selenate, methylmercury, or combination of the two have substantial implications for the ecology, population dynamics, and sustainability of M. scalaris populations. If these results can be extrapolated to other arthropod detritivores, ecosystem food-web function may be substantially affected. \u00a9 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc."

            "text": "Coconut production in Fiji was a mainstay of the economy and indigenous culture in the late 1800s to early 1900s. From around 1877 coconut production on Viti Levu was severely affected by Levuana iridescens Betheune-Baker, a small purple moth, whose larvae trenched the underside of coconut leaves. A variety of cultural and chemical control strategies over approximately a 16-yr period failed to bring this pest under effective control. A biological control program initiated in 1925 resulted in importation and release of a parasitic fly, Bessa remota (Aldrich), which provided immediate and effective control of L. iridescens. This well-documented classical biological control program has subsequently become highly controversial with regard to arguments over endemicism of L. iridescens to the Fijian archipelago and the possibility that B. remota has caused the extirpation of L. iridescens and the endemic Heteropan dolens Druce in Fiji. A synopsis is provided of the cultural, chemical, and biological control programs for L. iridescens in Fiji. In addition, evidence for extinction of L. iridescens and H. dolens is examined through an analysis of little-known literature and neglected museum records. It is suggested that the reason for lack of reports of L. iridescens after 1956 was due to the declining value of copra, which resulted in less research on coconuts; the recall from Fiji of entomologists that worked on the L. iridescens control program by the Imperial Bureau of Entomology; and the subsequent increased abundance of another leaf-trenching lepidopteran, Agonoxena argaula Meyrick, which would have made easy detection of low-density L. iridescens populations difficult. To verify the continued presence of L. iridescens and H. dolens in Fiji will require a comprehensive campaign employing visual searches of coconut palm fronds, the use of ground and aerial malaise traps, canopy fogging, and perhaps chemical analysis of unidentified lepidopteran pupal cocoons found on the thatch of coconut fronds for comparison with chemical profiles of known L. iridescens cocoons. \u00a9 2006 by University of Hawai'i Press.

            "text": "Introduction. Aedes albopictus is the second most important dengue virus vector in the Asian southeast after Aedes aegypti. Its entrance into the Americas occurred in 1985, and laboratory studies performed show its potential as a vector in this continent as well. In Colombia, this specie has been reported in Leticia (Amazonas) in 1998 and Buenaventura (Valle del Cauca) in 2001, The latest discoveries show that this mosquito continues to advance toward the country's interior. Objective. To inform the presence of A. albopictus is documented in the city of Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia. Materials and Methods. Since 2002, weekly sampling has been performed using larval traps located at seventeen stations. The identification of the A. albopictus species, was carried out in the Unidad de Entomolog\u00eda, Laboratorio de Salud P\u00fablica Departamental. These identifications were confirmed in the Entomology Laboratory at Universidad del Valle and the National Institute of Health in Bogot\u00e1. Results. From April to June of 2006, larvae of A. albopictus were found in six sampling stations located between northwest and northeast of Cali, one of them in the suburban area of the Yumbo city. Conclusion. The control of A. aegypti and A. albopictus must be integrated into a single program. The surveillance in the cities and nearest departments must be intensified with the objective of limiting the advancement of A. albopictus."

            "text": "Background: The globally important Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses are primarily transmitted by the invasive mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. In Australia, there is an increasing risk that these species may invade highly urbanized regions and trigger outbreaks. We describe the development of a Rapid Surveillance for Vector Presence (RSVP) system to expedite presence- absence surveys for both species. Methodology/Principal findings: We developed a methodology that uses molecular assays to efficiently screen pooled ovitrap (egg trap) samples for traces of target species ribosomal RNA. Firstly, specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were developed which detect a single Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus first instar larva in samples containing 4,999 and 999 non-target mosquitoes, respectively. ImageJ software was evaluated as an automated egg counting tool using ovitrap collections obtained from Brisbane, Australia. Qualitative assessment of ovistrips was required prior to automation because ImageJ did not differentiate between Aedes eggs and other objects or contaminants on 44.5% of ovistrips assessed, thus compromising the accuracy of egg counts. As a proof of concept, the RSVP was evaluated in Brisbane, Rockhampton and Goomeri, locations where Ae. aegypti is considered absent, present, and at the margin of its range, respectively. In Brisbane, Ae. aegypti was not detected in 25 pools formed from 477 ovitraps, comprising \u2248 54,300 eggs. In Rockhampton, Ae. aegypti was detected in 4/6 pools derived from 45 ovitraps, comprising \u2248 1,700 eggs. In Goomeri, Ae. aegypti was detected in 5/8 pools derived from 62 ovitraps, comprising \u2248 4,200 eggs. Conclusions/Significance: RSVP can rapidly detect nucleic acids from low numbers of target species within large samples of endemic species aggregated from multiple ovitraps. This screening capability facilitates deployment of ovitrap configurations of varying spatial scales, from a single residential block to entire suburbs or towns. RSVP is a powerful tool for surveillance of invasive Aedes spp., validation of species eradication and quality assurance for vector control operations implemented during disease outbreaks. \u00a9 2017 Montgomery et al."

Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to estimate the impact of guppy fish (guppies), in combination with the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen (Sumilarv\u00ae 2MR), and Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia. Methods/design: In this cluster randomized controlled, superiority trial, 30 clusters comprising one or more villages each (with approximately 170 households) will be allocated, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either (1) three interventions (guppies, Sumilarv\u00ae 2MR, and COMBI activities), (2) two interventions (guppies and COMBI activities), or (3) control (standard vector control). Households will be invited to participate, and entomology surveys among 40 randomly selected households per cluster will be carried out quarterly. The primary outcome will be the population density of adult female Aedes mosquitoes (i.e., number per house) trapped using adult resting collections. Secondary outcome measures will include the House Index, Container Index, Breteau Index, Pupae Per House, Pupae Per Person, mosquito infection rate, guppy fish coverage, Sumilarv\u00ae 2MR coverage, and percentage of respondents with knowledge about Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue. In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes density and mosquito infection rates will be aggregated over follow-up time points to give a single rate per cluster. This will be analyzed by negative binomial regression, yielding density ratios. Discussion: This trial is expected to provide robust estimates of the intervention effect. A rigorous evaluation of these vector-control interventions is vital to developing an evidence-based dengue control strategy and to help direct government resources.

            "text": "Background: Experiments involving mosquito mark-release-recapture (MRR) design are helpful to determine abundance, survival and even recruitment of mosquito populations in the field. Obstacles in mosquito MRR protocols include marking limitations due to small individual size, short lifespan, low efficiency in capturing devices such as traps, and individual removal upon capture. These limitations usually make MRR analysis restricted to only abundance estimation or a combination of abundance and survivorship, and often generate a great degree of uncertainty about the estimations. Methodology/Principal findings: We present a set of Bayesian biodemographic models designed to fit data from most common mosquito recapture experiments. Using both field data and simulations, we consider model features such as capture efficiency, survival rates, removal of individuals due to capturing, and collection of pupae. These models permit estimation of abundance, survivorship of both marked and unmarked mosquitoes, if different, and recruitment rate. We analyze the accuracy of estimates by varying the number of released individuals, abundance, survivorship, and capture efficiency in multiple simulations. These methods can stand capture efficiencies as low as usually reported but their accuracy depends on the number of released mosquitoes, abundance and survivorship. We also show that gathering pupal counts allows estimating differences in survivorship between released mosquitoes and the unmarked population. Conclusion/Significance: These models are important both to reduce uncertainty in evaluating MMR experiments and also to help planning future MRR studies. \u00a9 2017 Villela et al."

            "text": "Dengue is still one of major health problem in Indonesia. Dengue transmission is influenced by dengue prevention and eradication program, community participation, housing environment and climate. The complexity of the disease coupled with limited resources necessitates different approach for prevention methods that include factors contribute to the transmission. One way to prevent the dengue transmission is by reducing the mosquito's breeding sites. Four factors suspected to influence breeding sites are dengue prevention and eradication program, community participation, housing environment, and weather condition. In order to have an effective program in reducing the breeding site it is needed to have a model which can predict existence of the breeding sites while the four factors under study are controlled. The objective of this study is to develop an Ecohealth model using system dynamic as a planning tool for the reduction of breeding sites to prevent dengue transmission with regard to dengue prevention and eradication program, community participation, housing environment, and weather condition. The methodology is a mixed method study using sequential exploratory design. The study comprised of 3 stages: first a qualitative study to 14 respondents using in-depth interview and 6 respondents for focus group discussion. The results from the first stage was used to develop entomology and household survey questionnaires for second stage conducted in 2036 households across 12 sub districts in Bandung City. Ecohealth system dynamic model was developed using data from first and second stages. Analyses used are thematic analysis for qualitative data; spatial, generalized estimating equation (GEE) and structural equation modeling for quantitative data; also average mean error (AME) and average variance error (AVE) for dynamic system model validation. System dynamic model showed that the most effective approach to eliminate breeding places was by ensuring the availability of basic sanitation for all houses. Weather factors such as precipitation can be compensated with the eradication of breeding sites activities which is conducted as scheduled and at the same time for the whole areas. Conclusion of this study is that dengue prevention and eradication program, community participation, and housing environment contributed to breeding places elimination influenced the existence of the breeding sites. The availability of basic sanitation and breeding places eradication program done timely and collectively are the most effective approach to eradicate breeding sites. Ecohealth dynamic system model can be used as a tool for the planning of breeding sites eradication program to prevent disease transmissions at city level. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

The public health utility of these indicators is based on the assumption that greater mosquito abundance increases the risk of human DENV transmission, and therefore reducing exposure to the vector decreases incidence of infection. Entomological survey data from two longitudinal cohort studies in Iquitos, Peru, linked with 8,153 paired serological samples taken approximately six months apart were analyzed. Indicators of Ae. aegypti density were calculated from cross-sectional and longitudinal entomological data collected over a 12-month period for larval, pupal and adult Ae. aegypti. Log binomial models were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) to measure the association between Ae. aegypti abundance and the six-month risk of DENV seroconversion. RRs estimated using cross-sectional entomological data were compared to RRs estimated using longitudinal data. Higher cross-sectional Ae. aegypti densities were not associated with an increased risk of DENV seroconversion. Use of longitudinal entomological data resulted in RRs ranging from 1.01 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.02) to 1.30 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.46) for adult stage density estimates and RRs ranging from 1.21 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.37) to 1.75 (95% CI: 1.23, 2.5) for categorical immature indices. Ae. aegypti densities calculated from longitudinal entomological data were associated with DENV seroconversion, whereas those measured cross-sectionally were not. Ae. aegypti indicators calculated from cross-sectional surveillance, as is common practice, have limited public health utility in detecting areas or populations at high risk of DENV infection. \u00a9 2017 Cromwell et al."

            "text": "Background: Rhipicephalus microplus is a hard tick that has a major impact on cattle health in tropical and subtropical regions because it feeds on cattle and is implicated in the transmission of pathogens that cause diseases such as bovine anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Presently, acaricides are used to control tick infestation but this is becoming increasingly less effective due to the emergence of tick strains that are resistant to one or more classes of acaricides. Anti-tick vaccines are a promising alternative to control tick infestation in cattle. The life-cycle and host preference of R. microplus, however, makes vaccine research in cattle costly and would therefore greatly benefit from an in vitro screening system. Methods: To this aim, a stacked 24-well in vitro feeding system was designed in which the blood meal was administered in a chamber on top of the compartment containing the ticks, exploiting their anti-gravitational tendency. Both compartments were separated by a special feeding membrane, which was made by applying a silicone mixture to a gold beater's skin (baudruche membrane) with a paint roller to create a slightly uneven surface of 17-40 \u03bcm variable thickness. To further stimulate feeding, the membrane was treated with bovine hair extract and the unit was placed at 37 \u00b0C with 90% RH and 5% CO2. Results: Using this set-up with Rhipicephalus australis (formerly Rhipicephalus microplus), a larval engorgement rate of up to 71% could be achieved. The larvae could successfully feed on blood, but also on serum. The latter allows easy screening of the effect of sera that are raised against tick proteins on feeding. As an example, serum from cattle that were vaccinated with the Bm86 midgut protein of R. microplus significantly reduced larval engorgement rates by 42%. Conclusion: The in vitro feeding system's high throughput design and its ability to measure statistically significant anti-tick effects in sera from immunized cattle enables screening of multiple vaccine candidates in a cost-effective manner. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s)."

Aspects related to larval feeding and moulting to the first nymphal instar were evaluated. A total of 55.6% of all larvae exposed to the artificial membrane in two experimental groups fed to repletion and 98.0% of all fed larvae moulted. Mortality rates of first instar nymphs differed significantly depending on the sorting tools used to handle engorged larvae (\u03c72 = 35.578, P < 0.0001): engorged larvae handled with featherweight forceps showed significantly higher mortality (odds ratio = 4.441) than those handled with a camel-hair brush. Differences in the physical properties of the forceps and camel-hair brush may affect the viability of fragile soft tick larvae even when care and the same technique are used to sort them during experimental manipulations. The current results represent those of the first study to quantify successful feeding to repletion, moulting and post-moulting mortality rates in O. turicata larvae using an artificial membrane feeding system. Applications of the artificial membrane feeding system to fill gaps in current knowledge of soft tick biology and the study of soft tick\u2013pathogen interactions are discussed. \u00a9 2017 The Royal Entomological Society"

Previous studies have demonstrated that nonpathogenic endosymbiotic bacteria can interfere with Rickettsia co-infections in other tick species.Wehypothesized that within D. occidentalis ticks, interference may exist between different nonpathogenic endosymbiotic or nonendosymbiotic bacteria and Spotted Fever group Rickettsia (SFGR). Using PCR amplification and sequencing of the rompA gene and intergenic region we identified a cohort of SFGR-infected and non-infected D. occidentalis ticks collected from San Diego County. We then amplified a partial segment of the 16S rRNA gene and used next-generation sequencing to elucidate the microbiomes and levels of co-infection in the ticks. The SFGR R. philipii str. 364D and R. rhipicephali were detected in 2.3% and 8.2% of the ticks, respectively, via rompA sequencing. Interestingly, next generation sequencing revealed an inverse relationship between the number of Francisella-like endosymbiont (FLE) 16S rRNA sequences and Rickettsia 16S rRNA sequences within individual ticks that is consistent with partial interference between FLE and SFGR infecting ticks. After excluding the Rickettsia and FLE endosymbionts from the analysis, there was a small but significant difference in microbial community diversity and a pattern of geographic isolation by distance between collection locales. In addition, male ticks had a greater diversity of bacteria than female ticks and ticks that weren't infected with SFGR had similar microbiomes to canine skin microbiomes. Although experimental studies are required for confirmation, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that FLEs and, to a lesser extent, other bacteria, interfere with the ability of D. occidentalis to be infected with certain SFGR. The results also raise interesting possibilities about the effects of putative vertebrate hosts on the tick microbiome. Subjects: Entomology, Microbiology. \u00a9 2017 Gurfield et al."

            "text": "Background: The development of standardized in vitro feeding methods for ixodid ticks has been hampered by their complex feeding behaviour and the long duration of their blood meal. In this study, we aimed to optimize several parameters for the in vitro feeding of adult Dermacentor reticulatus. Methods: Ticks were fed on heparinized bovine blood collected at a slaughterhouse, using a modified silicone membrane feeding assay. Effects on tick feeding and fecundity of different blood meal treatments (freezing, irradiation, addition of antibiotics), ambient conditions (increased CO2 concentration) and phagostimulant use (addition of 2 g/l and 4 g/l glucose to the blood meal) were systematically evaluated. Results: Although fungal growth occurred more frequent in feeding units of ticks fed on defrosted blood, the attachment rate, engorgement mass and fecundity of females fed on defrosted blood did not significantly differ from that of ticks fed on fresh blood. A reduction in the fecundity of female D. reticulatus ticks was observed when ticks were fed with gamma-irradiated blood or untreated blood compared to blood treated with gentamycin. Both the engorgement mass and fecundity increased when ticks were fed at a 5% CO2 level. A non-significant increase in the engorgement mass and engorgement rate of D. reticulatus was observed when blood was supplemented with 4 g glucose per litre compared to 2 g/l. Conclusion: An artificial feeding method was adapted for the feeding of adult D. reticulatus ticks. Of all parameters tested, only the artificial feeding at 5% CO2 levels resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the engorgement mass and fecundity of female D. reticulatus ticks. The supplementation of blood with antibiotics resulted in a significantly higher tick fecundity in comparison to ticks fed with untreated or irradiated blood. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s)."

The aims of this contribution were to: a) analyze the diversity of Carabidae (species richness, activity, composition and structure of assemblages) in environments with different anthropic use; b) know the association of Carabidae species with herbaceous vegetation; c) analyze the proportion of species according to their specialisation to habitat requirements, capacity of dispersion in relation to wing dimorphism and sinanthropism, and d) identify typical species of different environments and e) record the presence of larvae. The study was conducted in an agroecosystem from Laguna Nahuel Ruca (37\u00b037'04'' S - 57\u00b025'16'' W). We selected different sampling environments: three forest environments, three open environments and a mixed environment; all of them were sampled monthly with \u201cpitfall\u201d traps during one year. We made a ranking to measure the degree of human modification of each environment. Higher values of species richness were recorded in forest environments. Carabidae assemblages differed according to habitat structure. We identified typical species of open environments as well as forest environments. The proportion of macropterous and synanthropic species tended to be higher in open environments, while there was no difference in the proportion of eurytopic species. Ten species of Carabidae were associated with families Convolvulaceae, Apiaceae and Fabaceae in spring. Seven species of larvae were recorded mainly in forest environments during summer. We concluded that land use and the structure of environment influence the local biodiversity of Carabidae. \u00a9 2017, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia. All rights reserved."

            "text": "Phoridae (scuttle flies) are widely distributed, occur in many types of habitats and are ecologically versatile, which makes them an excellent bioindicator group for evaluating faunal diversity. The structure of scuttle fly communities was compared in two Mediterranean habitats in the Montseny Natural Park (Catalonia, Spain) that differ in vegetation and microclimate: beech forest and highland scrubland. 3684 male individuals belonging to 135 species of scuttle flies were identified. Scuttle flies were more abundant in beech forest than scrubland. Observed and estimated species richness were lower in scrubland than in beech forest, while diversity was similar in both habitats. Community evenness was greater in scrubland than beech forest. Therefore, the percentage of dominant and subdominant species was higher in scrubland than beech forest, while the percentage of rare species was higher in beech forest than scrubland. Scuttle fly species composition was significantly different in the two habitats, but it was similar among plots within the same habitat. Megaselia pectoralis (Wood, 1910) and Megaselia subpleuralis (Wood, 1909) were the dominant species in beech forest, while Megaselia pusilla (Meigen, 1830), Megaselia pumila (Meigen, 1830), Megaselia superciliata (Wood, 1910) and Megaselia diversa (Wood, 1909) were the dominant species in scrubland. Trophic specialization was higher in beech forest than scrubland. Saprophages were the dominant trophic group in beech forest, while fungivores and polyphages were dominant in scrubland. The high biodiversity of scuttle flies recorded in the Montseny Natural Park indicates that there is also a high diversity of other taxa there and that these Mediterranean mountains are of high conservation status. \u00a9 Institute of Entomology, Biology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice."

Even with intense surveillance and vector control, large numbers of mosquitoes were present in this area. A detailed investigation allowed for the detection of Ae. aegypti in an underground reservoir used for rainwater storage. After the implementation of protection screens in the accesses, the presence of the vector was no longer detected. In this study, we discuss the frequent use of this type of reservoir structure and its risk for mosquito production. \u00a9 This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided that the original author and source are credited."

The standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA) is considered one of the \u201cgold standard\u201d assays for TBV development. However, lack of consensus in reporting results from SMFA has made it very challenging to compare results from different studies. Two main readouts, % inhibition in mean oocyst count per mosquito (TRA) and % inhibition in prevalence of infected mosquitoes (TBA), have been used widely. In this study, we statistically modeled the oocyst data in SMFA using data from 105 independent feeding experiments including 9804 mosquitoes. The model was validated using an independent data set that included 10,790 mosquitoes from 110 feeding studies. The model delineates a relationship between TRA, the mean oocyst count in the control mosquitoes (mo-contl), and TBA. While TRA was independent from mo-contl, TBA values changed depending on mo-contl. Regardless of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies tested, there were strong concordances between observed TBA and predicted TBA based on the model using mo-contl and observed TRA. Simulations showed that SMFA with lower true control means had increased uncertainty in TRA estimates. The strong linkage between TBA, TRA and mo-contl inspired creation of a standardized TBA, a model-based TBA standardized to a target control mean, which allows comparison across multiple feeds regardless of mo-contl. This is the first study showing that the observed TBA can be reasonably predicted by mo-contl and the TRA of the test antibody using independent experimental data. This study indicates that TRA should be used to compare results from multiple feeds with different levels of mo-contl. If a measure of TBA is desired, it is better to report standardized TBA rather than observed TBA. These recommendations support rational comparisons of results from different studies, thus benefiting future TBV development. \u00a9 2016"

Given that female flies and larvae are most abundant in animal carcasses or on corpses, precise morphological identification can be difficult; therefore, DNA sequencing can be an additional tool for use in taxonomic identification. This paper analyzes part of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from three Sarcophagidae species of forensic importance in the City of Rio de Janeiro: Oxysarcodexia fluminensis, Peckia chrysostoma, and Peckia intermutans. COI fragments of 400 bp from 36 specimens of these three species were sequenced. No intraspecific differences were found among specimens of O. fluminensis, but P. chrysostoma and P. intermutans each had two haplotypes, ranging from 0 to 0.7%. The interspecific divergence was 8.5-11.6%, corroborating previously reported findings. \u00a9 UNPEC-RP."

            "text": "Measurement of natural stable isotope signatures of insects has proven to be a useful method in determining their natal origin, feeding strategies and mating behavior, and has spawned a new discipline of insect isotope forensics. However the complexity of measuring isotope signatures using elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass-spectrometry (EA-IRMS) has encountered significant technical barriers, which together with costs, have hindered the advancement and wide spread adoption of this potentially useful approach. In the last decade simpler technologies to measure stable isotope ratios in samples based on laser spectroscopy have been developed. We foresee that these instruments will fuel the advancement and adoption of insect isotope forensics into pest management programs because they are easy to use, more affordable, and complement existing marking tools. However prior to the adoption of these new technologies it is necessary to test their fitness for purpose and explore their limitations. In this paper we set out to test the suitability of using combustion module-cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CM-CRDS) for measuring isotope ratios in an entomological context, covering marking of insects, mating behavior and dietary assessment. We carried out a series of experiments to compare the isotope measurements made with the CM-CRDS with the traditional method of EA-IRMS. Initially we compared measurements of carbon isotope values of a variety of common diet components used in insect rearing, which covered a wide range of carbon isotope values. There was good agreement in the isotope values obtained, using the CM-CRDS and the EA-IRMS with similar accuracy and precision. Secondly we compared the 2 methods to measure carbon isotope values of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) samples, and again there was good agreement in the values obtained. Thirdly we tested whether the CM-CRDS could be used to determine the paternity of spermataphores, based on the differential isotope signatures of the paternal and maternal moths, as a result of differences in their rearing diets. The CM-CRDS proved to be fit for the purpose of measuring isotope values in the spermataphores of common cutworm and suggested that the CM-CRDS technology would be suitable for these isotope based mating studies in moths if the spermatophores were of sufficient mass. Finally we explored a number of the issues surrounding CM-CRDS and isotope technologies in general, e.g., logistical considerations, economics of operation, sample size, etc. We conclude that CM-CRDS is a suitable instrument for measuring stable isotope carbon signatures in moths, and most probably other sufficiently large insects and that CM-CRDS could be easily used in both operational and research contexts. \u00a9 International Atomic Energy Agency 2016.

The research was carried out in a rural area of the stateof Morelos, Mexico, between 2006 and 2007. We carried out educational sessions with thepopulation in general, so that residents could identify the relationship between the vectorTriatoma pallidipennis, the parasite (Trypanosoma cruzi), symptoms, and preventive actionsfor Chagas disease. The ethnographic record and groups were analyzed based on Taylor andBogdan\u2019s modification, and the focus was to understand the socio-cultural meanings that guidethe speeches and activities of residents in relation to the pillars of community resilience.RESULTS: The population felt proud of belonging to that location and three pillars of communityresilience were clearly identified: collective self-esteem, cultural identity, and social honesty.Having these pillars as bases, we promoted the participation of the population concerningChagas disease, and a Community Action Group was formed with young people, adult men andwomen, and social leaders. This Group initiated actions of epidemiological and entomologicalsurveillance in the community to deal with this problem.CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to create more experiences that deepen the understanding ofthe pillars of community resilience, and how they contribute to enhance participation in healthto deal with Chagas disease \u00a9 This is an open-access article distributed under theterms of the Creative CommonsAttribution License, which permitsunrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium,provided that the original authorand source are credited"

The time interval between acquisition and subsequent transmission of the pathogen, called the extrinsic incubation period, is one of the most influential parameters of vector-borne pathogen transmission. However, the dynamic nature of this process is often ignored because vector competence assays are sacrificial and rely on end-point measurements. Here, we report that individual Aedes aegypti mosquitoes release large amounts of dengue virus (DENV) RNA in their excreta that can be nonsacrificially detected over time following oral virus exposure. Further, we demonstrate that detection of DENV RNA in excreta from individual mosquitoes is correlated to systemic viral dissemination with high specificity (0.9-1) albeit moderate sensitivity (0.64-0.89). Finally, we illustrate the potential of our finding to detect biological differences in the dynamics of DENV dissemination in a proof-ofconcept experiment. Individual measurements of the time required for systemic viral dissemination, a prerequisite for transmission, will be valuable to monitor the dynamics of DENV vector competence, to carry out quantitative genetics studies, and to evaluate the risk of DENV transmission in field settings."

Methods: Descriptive study with bibliometric approach conducted in three steps. (1) identification of bibliographic records using the following search strategy: \"Oswaldo Paulo Forattini\" OR \"Forattini OP\" OR \"Forattini\" up information sources Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed, in July 2016, which retrieved 867 records. (2) composition of research corpus, in which we included 351 bibliographic records of articles, books, book chapters, editorials, book reviews, informative notes and annual reports of the RSP and excluded 516 duplicates and acknowledgement notes, obituary notes, and nonretrievable citations. (3) data organization and analysis, in which we built databases for descriptive analysis and development of the MeSH coauthors and terms networks in VOSviewer software. For analysis of editorials, three reviewers read the full text of each editorial and categorized them according to subject, historical context and perspectives, relating them with historical milestones. Results: Forattini's scientific production occurred from 1946 to 2009, most consisting of articles (n = 218; 62.1%), editorials (n = 43; 12.3%), and books (n = 13; 3.7%). The main subjects were Culicidae (36.8%), Triatominae (12.5%), and Epidemiology (10.0%). The coauthors of articles were his professors, colleagues of his generation, and graduate students. His editorials addressed critical reflections on the production of knowledge, research priorities, and factors that contributed to or hindered progress. The scope of subjects is broad, referring to socioeconomic and scientific development, public health issues in developed countries, or global health. Conclusions: The analysis shows Forattini's commitment with public health, research with vectors, training of researchers, and scientific communication."

            "text": "Background: Stable reference genes are essential for accurate normalization in gene expression studies with reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A synanthropic fly, Chrysomya megacephala, is a well known medical vector and forensic indicator. Unfortunately, previous studies did not look at the stability of reference genes used in C. megacephala. Results: In this study, the expression level of Actin, ribosomal protein L8 (Rpl8), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1\u03b1 (EF1), \u03b1-tubulin (\u03b1-TUB), \u03b2-tubulin (\u03b2-TUB), TATA binding box (TBP), 18S rRNA (18S) and ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7) were evaluated for their stability using online software RefFinder, which combines the normal software of the \u0394Ct method, BestKeeper, Normfinder, and geNorm. Moreover the number of suitable reference gene pairs was also suggested by Excel-based geNorm. The expression levels of these reference genes were evaluated under different experimental conditions with special perspectives of forensic applications: developmental stages (eggs, first, second and third instar larvae, pupae and adults); food sources of larvae (pork, fish and chicken); feeding larvae with drugs (untreated control, Estazolam and Marvelon); feeding larvae with heavy metals (untreated control, cadmium and zinc); tissues of adults (head, thorax, abdomen, legs and wings). According to RefFinder, EF1 was the most suitable reference gene of developmental stages, food and tissues; 18S and GAPDH were the most suitable reference genes for drugs and heavy metals, respectively, which could be widely used for quantification of target gene expression with qPCR in C. megacephala. Suitable reference gene pairs were also suggested by geNorm. Conclusion: This fundamental but vital work should facilitate the gene studies of related biological processes and deepen the understanding in physiology, toxicology, and especially medical and forensic entomology of C. megacephala. \u00a9 2015 Wang et al."

This protocol describes a simple touch behavior in fruit flies which can be used to identify mutations that interfere with mechanosensation. The tactile stimulation of a macrochaete bristle on the thorax of flies elicits a grooming reflex from either the first or third leg. Mutations that interfere with mechanotransduction (such as NOMPC), or with other aspects of the reflex arc, can inhibit the grooming response. A traditional screen of adult behaviors would have missed mutants that have essential roles during development. Instead, this protocol combines the touch screen with mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) to allow for only limited regions of homozygous mutant cells to be generated and marked by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). By testing MARCM clones for abnormal behavioral responses, it is possible to screen a collection of lethal p-element mutations to search for new genes involved in mechanosensation that would have been missed by more traditional methods. \u00a9 2015 Journal of Visualized Experiments."

            "text": "The aims of this study were to describe the occurrence of dengue in space and time and to assess the relationships between dengue incidence and entomologic indicators. We selected the dengue autochthonous cases that occurred between September 2005 and August 2007 in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto to calculate incidence rates by month, year and census tracts. The monthly incidence rates of the city were compared to the monthly Breteau indices (BI) of the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Region. Between December 2006 and February 2007, an entomological survey was conducted to collect immature forms of Aedes aegypti in Jaguar\u00e9, a S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto neighborhood, and to obtain entomological indices. These indices were represented using statistical interpolation. To represent the occurrence of dengue in the Jaguar\u00e9 neighborhood in 2006 and 2007, we used the Kernel ratio and to evaluate the relationship between dengue and the entomological indices, we used a generalized additive model in a spatial case-control design. Between September 2005 and August 2007, the occurrence of dengue in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto was almost entirely caused by DENV3, and the monthly incidence rates presented high correlation coefficients with the monthly BI. In Jaguar\u00e9 neighborhood, the entomological indices calculated by hectare were better predictors of the spatial distribution of dengue than the indices calculated by properties, but the pupae quantification did not show better prediction qualities than the indices based on the container positivity, in relation to the risk of dengue occurrence. The fact that the municipality's population had a high susceptibility to the serotype DENV3 before the development of this research, along with the almost total predominance of the occurrence of this serotype between 2005 and 2007, facilitated the analysis of the epidemiological situation of the disease and allowed us to connect it to the entomological indicators. \u00a9 2014 The Authors."

            "text": "Background: The influence of environmental and climatic factors on malaria vector bionomics and transmission is an important topic in the context of climatic change particularly at macro-geographical level. Sahelian areas could be particularly affected due to heterogeneous features including high inter-annual variability in rainfall and others associated parameters. Therefore, baseline information on the impact of environmental and climatic factors on malaria transmission at micro-geographical level is required for vector risk management and implementation of control strategies. Methods: Malaria vectors were collected indoors by pyrethrum spray catches in 14 villages belonging to 4 different landscape classes (wooded savanna, shrubby savanna, bare soils and steppe) in the sylvo-pastoral area of Senegal. infection rates were determined using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: was the predominant species in all landscape classes and was the only species collected at the end of the rainy season excepted in villages located in bare soils where it cohabited with. Mean temperature and relative humidity showed similar variations in all the landscape classes covered whereas rainfall was more heterogeneous in terms of pattern, frequency and amount. The mean densities of displayed high seasonal differences with peaks observed in August or September. A positive non-significant correlation was observed between densities for rainfall and humidity whereas a negative non-significant correlation was reported for temperature. -infected mosquitoes were detected only in wooded savanna and bare soils villages. Conclusions: These observations suggest key roles played by landscape classes and rainfall in malaria vector densities, infection rates and malaria transmission that could be more pronounced in villages situated in wooded savanna and bare soils. Due to the close relationship between environmental and meteorological parameters in this Sahelian region, additional studies on the impact of these parameters are required to further ascertain their association with entomological parameters involved in malaria transmission. From the public health point of view, such information could be useful for human population settlements as well as for monitoring and modelling purposes giving early warning system for implementation of interventions in these unstable transmission zones. \u00a9 2014 Ngom et al.; licensee BioMed Central."

            "text": "Flies are frequently used for postmortem interval (PMI) estimations. These estimates are usually based on the age of larval or pupal specimens. However, the age defines only the minimum PMI. In order to move forensic entomology further, a method useful for the estimation of an interval preceding insect appearance on a corpse called the pre-appearance interval (PAI) is needed. Recently, it was demonstrated that the PAI of several carrion beetles is closely related to the temperature prevailing throughout this interval. Hence, it was postulated to estimate PAI from temperature. In order to check premises for using this approach with flies, a test of the relationship between adult or oviposition PAI and temperature was made for nine species of European flies. Data on PAI originated from pig carcasses decomposing under various temperatures. Adult PAI of Hydrotaea dentipes, Hydrotaea ignava, Hydrotaea similis, Phormia regina, and Stearibia nigriceps and oviposition PAI of S. nigriceps were exponentially related to temperature. Only S. nigriceps revealed a close relationship, demonstrating solid premises for PAI estimation from temperature alone. Adult and oviposition PAI of Calliphora vomitoria and adult PAI of Hydrotaea pilipes were not related to temperature. Adult and oviposition PAI of Lucilia sericata and Lucilia caesar responded similarly, with an abrupt and large increase in a narrow range of low temperatures and no response in a broad range of high temperatures. Probably, different mechanisms form the basis for the response of PAI to temperature in flies colonizing carcasses shortly after death and flies colonizing carcasses later in the decomposition process. \u00a9 2013, The Author(s)."

Given this, the last sixty years have seen many research efforts on this task. To date, however, none of this research has had a lasting impact. In this work, we explain this lack of progress. We attribute the stagnation on this problem to several factors, including the use of acoustic sensing devices, the overreliance on the single feature of wingbeat frequency, and the attempts to learn complex models with relatively little data. In contrast, we show that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce vastly superior data, that we can exploit additional features, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect's flight behavior, and that a Bayesian classification approach allows us to efficiently learn classification models that are very robust to overfitting. We demonstrate our findings with large scale experiments, as measured both by the number of insects and the number of species considered. \u00a9 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

This study uses a combination of cytochrome oxidase subunit I barcode sequencing and geometric morphometric analyses to investigate wing shape as a means to infer species identification within this subgenus. In addition the congruence of morphological data with different phylogenetic hypotheses is tested. Five different species of the subgenus Avaritia were considered in the study (C. obsoletus (Meigen); C. scoticus Kettle and Lawson; C. chiopterus (Meigen); C. dewulfi Goetghebuer and C. imicola (Kieffer)). The study demonstrated that over 90% of individuals could be separated correctly into species by their wing shape and that patterns of morphological differentiation derived from the geometric morphometric analyses were congruent with phylogenies generated from sequencing data. Morphological data produced are congruent with monophyly of the subgenus Avaritia and the exclusion of C. dewulfi from the group containing C. obsoletus, C. scoticus and C. chiopterus. The implications of these results and their importance in a wider context of integrating multiple data types to interpret both phylogeny and species characterization is discussed. \u00a9 2014 The Royal Entomological Society."

Habitats substrate, substrate moisture, and light levels can affect the host searching of different species of parasitoids. However, the depth at which parasitoids concentrate their search effort is another important ecological characteristic and plays an important role in locating a host. Here, we investigated the ability of a pupal parasitoid, Nasonia vitripennis Walker (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), to penetrate and kill fly pupae located at different depths of the substrate. Three different types of substrate were tested: loam soil, compost, and vermiculite substrate. In both loam soil and compost, all of the parasitism activity was restricted to pupae placed directly on the surface. Parasitism activity in vermiculite showed that the average number of pupae parasitized decreased with depth of substrate. These results suggest that fly pupae situated deeper in the substrate are less subjected to parasitism by N. vitripennis. \u00a9 This is an open access paper."

            "text": "Background:Glossina palpalis palpalis (G. p. palpalis) is one of the principal vectors of sleeping sickness and nagana in Africa with a geographical range stretching from Liberia in West Africa to Angola in Central Africa. It inhabits tropical rain forest but has also adapted to urban settlements. We set out to standardize a long-lasting, practical and cost-effective visually attractive device that would induce the strongest landing response by G. p. palpalis for future use as an insecticide-impregnated tool in area-wide population suppression of this fly across its range.Methodology/Principal Findings:Trials were conducted in wet and dry seasons in the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola to measure the performance of traps (biconical, monoconical and pyramidal) and targets of different sizes and colours, with and without chemical baits, at different population densities and under different environmental conditions. Adhesive film was used as a practical enumerator at these remote locations to compare landing efficiencies of devices. Independent of season and country, both phthalogen blue-black and blue-black-blue 1 m2 targets covered with adhesive film proved to be as good as traps in phthalogen blue or turquoise blue for capturing G. p. palpalis. Trap efficiency varied (8-51%). There was no difference between the performance of blue-black and blue-black-blue 1 m2 targets. Baiting with chemicals augmented the overall performance of targets relative to traps. Landings on smaller phthalogen blue-black 0.25 m2 square targets were not significantly different from either 1 m2 blue-black-blue or blue-black square targets. Three times more flies were captured per unit area on the smaller device.Conclusions/Significance:Blue-black 0.25 m2 cloth targets show promise as simple cost effective devices for management of G. p. palpalis as they can be used for both control when impregnated with insecticide and for population sampling when covered with adhesive film. \u00a9 2014 Kaba et al."

However, the link between the two is strong and one, global warming is strictly an average increase in the temperature of the atmosphere near the earth\u2019s surface and in the troposphere, while the other, climate change is more diverse and refers to any significant change in measures of climate such as temperature, precipitation, or wind lasting for a long period of time usually several years. Climate change could thus be an increase or decrease in temperature. The most important of the two terms which is under spotlight is global warming, an increase in temperature which has been blamed largely to greenhouse effect. There can no longer be any doubt that the earth\u2019s climate is changing. It is now obvious that even the most hardened sceptics are starting to waiver in their convictions. Climate has been thrown completely out of kilter and each day brings fresh proof such as frequent and more violent cyclones in the Caribean, floods in Africa, the Philippines, the gradual sinking of Islands in the Pacific, heat waves in Europe and the melting of glaciers. There is increase in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and rising global average sea level. Impacts of global warming include the emergence and re-emergence of some parasitic infections and diseases. \u00a9 Atehmengo et al.; Licensee Bentham Open."

            "text": "Use of radar in ornithology, chiropterology and entomology continues to increase, driven in part by widespread online data availability. In addition to research applications, rapid growth in areas such as wind energy and aviation has prompted the use of radar for conservation. While a variety of research applications motivate ecologists to gain basic radar literacy, the ability to process and analyse radar data sets can be a daunting task that may dissuade inexperienced ecological radar users. This effect is exacerbated by vague radar methodologies in the ecology literature, as well as the combination of complex techniques and unfamiliar terminology in other radar-focused disciplines. While radar data come in many formats and levels of detail, a common type is the two-dimensional radar image. As rasters of data with associated spatial coordinates, radar images are relatively easy to manipulate, especially for those familiar with basic raster computations. Furthermore, because radar image data require relatively small storage space, they can be readily downloaded from a number of online sources. With this in mind, radar images provide a convenient foundation for ecological applications. A primer on radar image interpretation and processing is presented, with a focus on image composition for typical atmospheric surveillance radar scans. Additionally, a selection of existing ecological radar image processing methods are overviewed. As a starting point, a basic algorithm for automated image processing is outlined that may be modified to create specialized workflows. Three examples of the application of this algorithm are included, illustrating its modification and use for automated feature extraction. By outlining a basic algorithm, we hope to provide a clear starting point for the beginning radar user. When combined with additional existing methods, this algorithm provides a wide range of refinements and modifications that can pave a path towards sophisticated radar processing workflows. In the long term, the ability of ecologists to independently analyse radar data will lead to better ecological interpretation of radar data and a more informed application to conservation policy. \u00a9 2014 British Ecological Society."

To accomplish this, a sampling device consisting of an air compressor for pest agitation, a sticky trap (100. mm. \u00d7. 150. mm) and an image processing system for pest identification were installed on the Cabbot. The sampling precision of the Cabbot (D= 0.16) was higher than that of the sticky trap (D= 0.19) when sampling of adult white flies was conducted in caged pots. The Cabbot could also collect a substantial number of individuals within a short duration (3. minutes). The collection efficiency (i.e., percent of samples collected at least n (1 in this case) individuals to the total sample number) of insects by the Cabbot was markedly high at low population size, showing approximately 30% when the population size was \u2264. 16 individuals per plant. The sampling precision and collection efficiency suggested that the Cabbot is effective in local, short-term sampling and could be used for early warning of pest occurrences. \u00a9 2014 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society."

However, these applications are limited to laboratory data only. In this study, we investigated the population dynamics of three species of blowflies [Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann), Chrysomya megacephala (F.) and Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann)] in a mathematical model that includes parameters estimated in the laboratory and population sizes estimated from field collections, in order to simulate the dynamics of local migration. The model combines experimental estimates of fecundity and survival with abundance data obtained in field collections, to analyze comparatively the population dynamics of the three blowfly species, taking into account the theoretical movement by individuals among municipalities with different urbanization profiles. The ecological patterns of oscillation observed depended on the municipality only for C. albiceps, a species with special demographic characteristics that are probably associated with predatory and cannibalistic behaviors. The bifurcation diagrams showed that intermediate migration rates stabilize populations. Although the proposed model considers only six municipalities in a closed system, the study was able to show different impacts of local migration on the quantitative and qualitative population behaviors, by using different connectivity levels arising from the different distances among areas."

However, these studies have always measured foraging at artificial, static baits that omit traits of living prey items and potential coevolutionary predator-prey relationships. In a series of lab experiments, we compare the ability of ants to harvest live termites (Reticulitermes virginicus) in nests varying in defensive ability. Moreover, we compare foraging performance of 2 co-occurring ant species - the North American native Aphaenogaster rudis and the invasive Pachycondyla chinensis - differing in their evolutionary experience hunting R. virginicus. Our results show how the invasive P. chinensis may displace the native keystone A. rudis by directly killing A. rudis workers and reducing termite prey available for A. rudis. Specifically, P. chinensis is more sensitive to novel termite prey than the native A. rudis and then destroys termite colonies - even if they are highly defended by soldiers or nest architecture. Our results further show how whole colony behavioral dominance by P. chinensis is mediated by behavioral interactions among individual workers. More generally, our experimental approach using live prey to study interspecific competition can integrate evolutionary dynamics into studies of proximate behavioral factors governing species coexistence. \u00a9 The Author 2013."

The traits measured were body length, antenna length, lengths and widths of genal processes, and forewing length and width. Females and males were analyzed separately. The measures obtained were subjected to an analysis of variance and principal components analysis. The greatest morphometrical variation and smallest sizes were found in males collected from non-prefered hosts such as Citrus limetta Risso, C. sinensis (L.) 'Selection 8' and C. paradisi Macfad.; while, the least variations and largest sizes were found on C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck cv. 'Marrs', C. sinensis (L.) cv. 'Valencia' and Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack. The traits with notable variation were lengths and widths of forewings and genal processes. Greater morphometrical variations were found in males than in females. The results indicate that D. citri is a species with morphometrical variants and probably the host is a determinant in the definition of characters."

This study investigates the optimal trapping strategy to estimate the abundance or presence/absence of Culicoides on a field with grazing animals. We used 45 light traps to sample specimens from the Culicoides obsoletus species complex on a 14 hectare field during 16 nights in 2009. Findings. The large number of traps and catch nights enabled us to simulate a series of samples consisting of different numbers of traps (1-15) on each night. We also varied the number of catch nights when simulating the sampling, and sampled with increasing minimum distances between traps. We used resampling to generate a distribution of different mean and median abundance in each sample. Finally, we used the hypergeometric distribution to estimate the probability of falsely detecting absence of vectors on the field. The variation in the estimated abundance decreased steeply when using up to six traps, and was less pronounced when using more traps, although no clear cutoff was found. Conclusions: Despite spatial clustering in vector abundance, we found no effect of increasing the distance between traps. We found that 18 traps were generally required to reach 90% probability of a true positive catch when sampling just one night. But when sampling over two nights the same probability level was obtained with just three traps per night. The results are useful for the design of vector monitoring programmes on fields with grazing animals. \u00a9 2013 Kirkeby et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Here, we report the de novo discovery of microsatellite markers for the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis using cloning/Sanger sequencing and direct 454 pyrosequencing from microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries. We identified and successfully multiplexed 18 highly variable microsatellite markers in 585 individuals. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 23, and the expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.056 to 0.912. These genetic markers will allow for the investigation of levels of inbreeding and fine-scale population structure in C. inaequalis. Our results contribute to the literature demonstrating that 454 sequencing is more time- and cost-efficient than cloning/Sanger sequencing at identifying a large number of genomic regions with microsatellite repeat motifs. \u00a9 2012 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France."

Red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, tend honeydew-producing hemipteran insects and reduce the activity of these insects' enemies. Anthemipteran interactions frequently exert positive effects on the densities of hemipterans. We tested the hypothesis that ant tending can increase the densities of the mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), and reduce the densities of the mealybug's predatory and parasitic enemies, the lady beetle, Menochilus sexmaculata Fabricius (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and the parasitoid wasp, Aenasius bambawalei Hayat (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). We found that more ants foraged on mealybug-infested hibiscus plants than on mealybug-free plants. The number of foraging ants on plants infested with high densities of mealybugs (62.5 ants per plant) was nearly six times that on mealybug-free plants (10.2 ants per plant). Experiment results showed that ant tending significantly increased the survival of mealybugs: if predatory and parasitic enemies were present, the survival of mealybugs tended by fire ants was higher than that in the absence of tending ants. Furthermore, this tending by fire ants significantly decreased the survival of lady beetle larvae. However, no apparent effect was observed on the survival of parasitoid. \u00a9 2013 Entomological Society of America."

The cerambycid beetles Tetraopes femoratus (LeConte) puncture the leaf midrib vein to extravasate the latex, and thus render the leaf edible. Nonetheless, it has not yet been investigated whether there is any further implication beyond food acquisition regarding this behaviour. The present study examined the hypothesis that leaf latex drainage is done mainly by females of T. femoratus, and that the males opportunistically prefer to feed on those 'disarmed' leaves. The experiments revealed that puncturing the leaf midrib vein to extravasate latex is done mainly by females of T. femoratus and not only serves their purpose of food acquisition, but also mediates an opportunistic feeding behaviour among males. Males of T. femoratus preferred to feed on milkweed leaves that had previously been fed upon by females. In addition, field observations showed that mating occurred more frequently on recently 'disarmed' leaves, suggesting increased copulation opportunities for females during leaf feeding. In sum, the results reveal that the feeding defence strategy of T. femoratusfemales to toxic milkweed foliage has created an opportunity for males to feed on milkweed leaves with a reduced risk of latex exposure and entanglement. Thus, this research provides empirical evidence of plant-insect interactions contributing to the appearance of an opportunistic adaptive feeding behaviour, which has broader implications for eco-evolutionary systems. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Entomological Society."

With species of ash distributed throughout North America, it is easy to speculate the extinction of all susceptible species of ash on the continent given a lack of physical, environmental, or climactic barrier for dispersal of the insect. We investigated water balance characteristics of emerald ash borer ova by using gravimetric methods in an effort to measure their response to heat- and water-stress and explore possible influences this stress may have on the ecology and physiology of the ovum. We also explored the possible water balance benefit of a peculiar, \"clustering,\" oviposition behavior, as well as the difference in responses to stress between ova from a laboratory colony and ova from two wild populations. We found no evidence of water vapor absorption as a water balance strategy; rather enhanced water retention, resistance to desiccation, and viability with low water content were important survival strategies for these ova. Surface lipids resist thermal breakdown as indicated by ova having no detectable critical transition temperature, maintaining their water-proofing function as temperature rises. The observed \"clustering\" behavior had no desiccation-avoidance benefit and ova from the wild populations behaved almost identically to the ova from the lab colony, although the lab ova were slightly larger and more sensitive to dehydration. Given this new information, there appears to be no heat- or water-stress barriers for the dispersal of this devastating pest at the ovum stage. \u00a9 2013 Entomological Society of America."

            "text": "Selective logging is practiced extensively within tropical rainforests of south-east Asia, and its impact on local biodiversity is well documented. Little is known, however, about the impact of selective logging on patterns of spatial heterogeneity of species. We set out to test the hypothesis that selective logging will lead to a homogenization of the associated faunal assemblages, using moths (Lepidoptera) as our subject taxa. Large-scale transects were established within primary and post-logging lowland mixed dipterocarp rainforests around the Danum Valley Conservation Area and surroundings, Sabah, Malaysia (4\u00b050\u2032N-5\u00b000\u2032N and 117\u00b035\u2032E-117\u00b045\u2032E). Five study sites were located within each habitat with geometrically increasing inter-site distances. Macro-moths plus Pyraloidea were sampled by light trapping in 2007 and 2008. Vegetation state was also measured at each site. A clear distance-decay relationship (decreasing assemblage similarity with increasing geographic distances) was observed in primary forest but was absent in the post-logging forest. Large, comparable numbers of macro-moth species were found in both primary and post-logging forests. There were no significant differences in moth assemblage composition between primary and post-logging forests. There are important structural differences between primary and post-logging forests reflected in the moth assemblages. A two-stage hypothesis combining both neutral and niche concepts is probably the most parsimonious explanation of these results. First, the composition of the moth assemblage is almost certainly determined locally by the variety of plant-hosts available to larvae, with the plants representing important niche dimensions for the moth species. Second the turnover (or lack of same) in the underlying plant assemblage probably reflects clumping and, in turn, dispersal capacity of the commoner plants in each forest type. Although the impact of selective logging may be subtle, this study suggests that selective logging results in the spatial homogenization of macro-moth assemblages. \u00a9 2013 The Authors."

The important beneficial species are also included. Organisms are described in a classification of insect Orders and Families. The emphasis is on morphological characters of major taxonomic divisions, \"spot characters\" for the recognition of Families, and the life histories, damage symptoms and economic importance of the various pest species. The book is beautifully illustrated in full colour with more than 400 figures showing both the organisms and the damage caused to plants with diagnostic characters indicated by arrows. Coverage is world-wide and includes much material stemming from the vast personal experience of the author.

            "text": "Background: The question whether Plasmodium falciparum infection affects the fitness of mosquito vectors remains open. A hurdle for resolving this question is the lack of appropriate control, non-infected mosquitoes that can be compared to the infected ones. It was shown recently that heating P. falciparum gametocyte-infected blood before feeding by malaria vectors inhibits the infection. Therefore, the same source of gametocyte-infected blood could be divided in two parts, one heated, serving as the control, the other unheated, allowing the comparison of infected and uninfected mosquitoes which fed on exactly the same blood otherwise. However, before using this method for characterizing the cost of infection to mosquitoes, it is necessary to establish whether feeding on previously heated blood affects the survival and fecundity of mosquito females. Methods. Anopheles gambiae M molecular form females were exposed to heated versus non-heated, parasite-free human blood to mimic blood meal on non-infectious versus infectious gametocyte-containing blood. Life history traits of mosquito females fed on blood that was heat-treated or not were then compared. Results: The results reveal that heat treatment of the blood did not affect the survival and fecundity of mosquito females. Consistently, blood heat treatment did not affect the quantity of blood ingested. Conclusions: The study indicates that heat inactivation of gametocyte-infected blood will only inhibit mosquito infection and that this method is suitable for quantifying the fitness cost incurred by mosquitoes upon infection by P. falciparum. \u00a9 2013 Sangare et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

After the founding of the independent Latvia state in 1918, fruit growing developed rapidly. Although in the Soviet times the situation was not favourable for quality fruit growing, research and breeding continued with good results. After Latvia regained independence, private land property rights were restored, and interest in intensive orchard establishment and growing technologies increased rapidly, which demanded change in the research focus. At present, the Latvia State Institute of Fruit-Growing is the leading institution in this field, working in cooperation with P\u016bre Horticultural Research Centre, Latvian Plant Protection Research Centre, Institute of Agrobiotechology, and Faculty of Food Technology, Latvia University of Agriculture, Laboratory of Plant Mineral Nutrition, Institute of Biology, University of Latvia. Research is carried out in the following directions: breeding and cultivar evaluation; genetics and molecular biology; plant pathology and entomology; orchard management; experimental processing and storage."

Different physical conditions of cadavers may influence the fauna and the importance of freezing and thawing is unknown. The present paper sought to survey the Coleoptera species encountered in frozen and fresh rabbit carcasses, at a forest in Curitiba, Brazil. Four rabbit carcasses, two of them fresh and the other frozen were used. The coleopterofauna was sampled daily, and analyzed using non-parametric tests. A total of 666 beetles were sampled, belonging to 28 species in 10 families. Most of the beetles captured were larvae of Oxelytrum spp. (433) which are known to be necrophagous. The two frozen carcasses accounted for most of the beetles (338 and 180) in comparison with the two fresh carcasses (103 and 45). The tests were based on the most abundant species. Oxelytrum spp. median differed significantly between carcasses (H = 12.47844; p = 0.0059). The two fresh carcasses differed significantly (U = 190.0; p = 0.00019), but there was no significant difference between the frozen carcasses (U = 336.0; p = 0.29755). The data indicate that the freezing process prevents certain species to colonize carcasses, in this case with the dominance of species of Oxelytrum. These data also indicate that careful attention is necessary before using frozen carcasses in forensic entomology studies."

            "text": "Background: Chagas disease prevention critically depends on keeping houses free of triatomine vectors. Insecticide spraying is very effective, but re-infestation of treated dwellings is commonplace. Early detection-elimination of re-infestation foci is key to long-term control; however, all available vector-detection methods have low sensitivity. Chemically-baited traps are widely used in vector and pest control-surveillance systems; here, we test this approach for Triatoma spp. detection under field conditions in the Gran Chaco. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a repeated-sampling approach and logistic models that explicitly take detection failures into account, we simultaneously estimate vector occurrence and detection probabilities. We then model detection probabilities (conditioned on vector occurrence) as a function of trapping system to measure the effect of chemical baits. We find a positive effect of baits after three (odds ratio [OR] 5.10; 95% confidence interval [CI95] 2.59-10.04) and six months (OR 2.20, CI95 1.04-4.65). Detection probabilities are estimated at p \u2248 0.40-0.50 for baited and at just p \u2248 0.15 for control traps. Bait effect is very strong on T. infestans (three-month assessment: OR 12.30, CI95 4.44-34.10; p \u2248 0.64), whereas T. sordida is captured with similar frequency in baited and unbaited traps. Conclusions/Significance: Chemically-baited traps hold promise for T. infestans surveillance; the sensitivity of the system at detecting small re-infestation foci rises from 12.5% to 63.6% when traps are baited with semiochemicals. Accounting for imperfect detection, infestation is estimated at 26% (CI95 16-40) after three and 20% (CI95 11-34) after six months. In the same assessments, traps detected infestation in 14% and 8.5% of dwellings, whereas timed manual searches (the standard approach) did so in just 1.4% of dwellings only in the first survey. Since infestation rates are the main indicator used for decision-making in control programs, the approach we present may help improve T. infestans surveillance and control program management. \u00a9 2012 Rojas de Arias et al."

            "text": "Ecdysteroids are polyhydroxylated steroids that act as moulting hormones in arthropods and regulate several important life-cycle processes. Phytoecdysteroids are ecdysteroid analogues produced by some plants that disrupt the growth and development of insects feeding on them, and can be perceived by the taste receptors of insects. The present study tested the hypothesis that the blood-feeding tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille, 1806) (Acari: Ixodidae) is capable of detecting phytoecdysteroids. By recording from the chelicerae, six phytoecdysteroids are tested: \u03b1-ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, ponasterone A, makisterone A, inokosterone and pterosterone. In unfed ticks, makisterone A and pterosterone elicit frequencies of neural impulses higher than in a negative control (a KCl solution at 10 -3m), with detection thresholds of 10 -6m and 10 -12m, respectively. The spike amplitudes of the responses to these compounds, and also for 20-hydroxyecdysone and ponasterone A, are higher than in the control, indicating that a different neurone may be involved: perhaps a deterrent cell, as observed in insects. In fed ticks, only pterosterone at 10 -4m remains active. In behavioural attachment assays, no difference is observed between electrophysiologically active compounds and the negative control. These results show the capability of R. sanguineus ticks to detect phytoecdysteroids, although they do not clarify the role of ecdysteroids in tick biology, for which further studies are required. \u00a9 2012 The Authors.

Our method is based on the remote acquisition of passive sunlight scattering by two insect species. Procedures to identify rare events in remote dark-field spectroscopy are explained. We further demonstrate how to reduce the spectral representation, and how to discriminate between sexes, using a hierarchical clustering analysis. One-day cycle showing the temporal activities of the two sexes as well as data on activity patterns in relation to temperature and wind is presented. We also give a few examples of the potential use of the technique for studying interactions between sexes on a time scale of milliseconds. \u00a9 2012 IEEE."

We assessed the biological effects of UVB radiation on the eggs of the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, under both near ambient (UV+) and UV-attenuated (UV-) conditions from spring to autumn and compared them to the effects of temperature and humidity. The ambient daily UVB irradiance increased from January to August and then decreased rapidly until December, whereas egg hatchability under UV+ was lowest in April (10. 7%) and increased almost linearly until October (74. 9-92. 3%). In contrast, hatchability under UV- was consistently high (96. 2-99. 8%) through all seasons. For UV+, the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis supported the negative correlation of hatchability with cumulative UVB irradiance during egg periods (cumulative dose), but did not support that with the mean daily UVB irradiance (dose rate), suggesting that UVB-induced mortality in T. urticae eggs is cumulative dose dependent rather than dose rate dependent. The high mortality in April may have reflected the slower development caused by the relatively lower temperature and higher UVB radiation, increasing the cumulative dose, while the low mortality in October may have reflected the faster development caused by the relatively higher temperature and lower UVB radiation, decreasing the cumulative dose. \u00a9 2012 The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology."

            "text": "The aim of this work is to validate the preexisting models that relate the larvicidal and adulticidal activities of the Eucalyptus essential oils on Aedes aegypti. Previous works at our laboratory described that the larvicidal activity of Eucalyptus essential oils can be estimated from the relative concentration of two main components (p-cymene and 1,8-cineole) and that the adulticidal effectiveness can be explained, to a great extent, by the presence of large amounts of the component 1,8-cineole in it. In general, the results show that the higher adulticidal effect of essential oils the lower their larvicidal activity. Fresh leaves was harvested and distilled. Once the essential oil was obtained, the chemical composition was analysed, evaluating the biological activity of 15 species of the genus Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus badjensis Beuzev and Welch, Eucalyptus badjensis \u00d7 nitens, Eucalyptus benthamii var Benthamii Maiden and Cambage, Eucalyptus benthamii var dorrigoensis Maiden and Cambage, Eucalyptus botryoides Smith, Eucalyptus dalrympleana Maiden, Eucalyptus fastigata Deane and Maiden, Eucalyptus nobilis L.A. S. Johnson and K.D. Hill, Eucalyptus polybractea R. Baker, Eucalyptus radiata ssp radiata Sieber ex Spreng, Eucalyptus resinifera Smith, Eucalyptus robertsonii Blakely, Eucalyptus robusta Smith, Eucalyptus rubida Deane and Maiden, Eucalyptus smithii R. Baker). Essential oils of these plant species were used for the validation of equations from preexistent models, in which observed and estimated values of the biological activity were compared. The regression analysis showed a strong validation of the models, re-stating the trends previously observed. The models were expressed as follows: A, fumigant activity [KT 50(min)=10.65-0. 076\u00d71,8-cineole (%)](p<0.01; F, 397; R 2, 0.79); B, larval mortality (%) (40 ppm)=103.85+0.482\u00d7 p-cymene (%)-0.363\u00d7\u03b1-pinene (%)-1.07\u00d71,8-cineole (%) (p<0.01; F, 300; R 2, 0.90). These results confirmed the importance of the mayor components in the biological activity of Eucalyptus essential oils on A. aegypti. However, it is worth mentioning that two or three species differ in the data estimated by the models, and these biological activity results coincide with the presence of minor differential components in the essential oils. According to what was previously mentioned, it can be inferred that the model is able to estimate very closely the biological activity of essential oils of Eucalyptus on A. aegypti. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012."

            "text": "Increasing urbanisation is often cited as a cause of declining biodiversity, but for bumblebees there is evidence that urban populations of some species such as Bombus terrestris L. may be more dense than those found in agricultural landscapes, perhaps because gardens provide plentiful floral resources and nesting opportunities. Here we examine the influence of urbanisation on the prevalence of the main protozoan parasites of bumblebees in west central Scotland. We would expect transmission rates and prevalence of parasites to be higher in high density host populations, all else being equal. Workers of two bee species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, were sampled over a 45-day period in mid to late summer, and parasites were detected in faeces and via dissection. A comparison of the two methods suggests that faecal sampling is considerably less sensitive than dissection, failing to detect infection in 27.8%, 55.1%, and 80% of cases of infection with the parasites Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, and Apicystis bombi, respectively. For all three parasites, broad patterns of prevalence were similar, with prevalence tending to increase with urbanisation in B. terrestris but not in B. pascuorum. The different patterns of seasonal prevalence in the two bee species suggest that intraspecific transmission is more important that interspecific transmission. Our observation of greater parasite prevalence among B. terrestris in urban compared with rural areas suggests that urban habitats may present greater opportunities for parasite transmission. Greater bee densities in urban areas may be the driving factor; however, further study is still needed. For example, differences in disease prevalence between habitats could be driven by differences in the types and abundance of flowers that are available, or in exposure to environmental stressors. \u00a9 2012 The Authors.

This study aimed to know flies diversity and abundance in Campo Grande, State of Mato Grosso do Sul. Captures were made weekly, utilizing three traps baited with decaying fish meat, from June of 2008 to May of 2009 in a remainder ciliary forest of the Embrapa's Cattle Beef Experimental Farm. The dipterans families that were considered and respectively number of collected specimens were: Calliphoridae (105,334); Muscidae (27,999); Sarcophagidae (21,083); Fanniidae (17,759) and Mesembrinellidae (305), totalizing 172,480 dipterous. To the local known species some Muscidae were increased as follows: Neomuscina atincticosta, Pseudoptilolepis elbida, Polietina orbitalis, Polietina flavithorax, Scutellomusca scutellaris, Graphomya analis and Morellia couriae."

However, this method has not been used in mosquito vectors to date. To this end, we have developed an LMM method to isolate midgut RNA using Aedes aegypti. Results: Total RNA was isolated from Ae. aegypti midguts that were either fresh-frozen or fixed with histological fixatives. Generally, fresh-frozen tissue sections are a common source of quality LMM-derived RNA; however, our aim was to develop an LMM protocol that could inactivate pathogenic viruses by fixation, while simultaneously preserving RNA from arbovirus-infected mosquitoes. Three groups (10 - 15 mosquitoes per group) of female Ae. aegypti at 24 or 48-hours post-blood meal were intrathoracically injected with one of seven common fixatives (Bouin's, Carnoy's, Formoy's, Cal-Rite, 4% formalin, 10% neutral buffered formalin, or zinc formalin) to evaluate their effect on RNA quality. Total RNA was isolated from the fixed abdomens using a Trizol\u00ae method. The results indicated that RNA from Carnoy's and Bouin's fixative samples was comparable to that of fresh frozen midguts (control) in duplicate experiments. When Carnoy's and Bouin's were used to fix the midguts for the LMM procedure, however, Carnoy's-fixed RNA clearly showed much less degradation than Bouin's-fixed RNA. In addition, a sample of 5 randomly chosen transcripts were amplified more efficiently using the Carnoy's treated LMM RNA than Bouin's-fixed RNA in quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays, suggesting there were more intact target mRNAs in the Carnoy's fixed RNA. The yields of total RNA ranged from 0.3 to 19.0 ng per \u223c3.0 \u00d7 106 m2 in the LMM procedure. Conclusions: Carnoy's fixative was found to be highly compatible with LMM, producing high quality RNA from Ae. aegypti midguts while inactivating viral pathogens. Our findings suggest that LMM in conjunction with Carnoy's fixation can be applied to studies in Ae. aegypti infected with arboviruses without compromising biosafety and RNA quality. This LMM method should be applicable to other mosquito vector studies. \u00a9 2011 Hong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Ophyra albuquerquei Lopes, for example, can be found in animal carcasses. The influence of environmental factors has not been evaluated in puparia of O. albuquerquei. Thus, the focus of this work was motivated by the need for models to predict the development of a necrophagous insect as a function of abiotic factors. Colonies of O. albuquerquei were maintained in the laboratory to obtain pupae. On the tenth day of each month 200 pupae, divided equally into 10 glass jars, were exposed to the environment and checked daily for adult emergence of each sample. We concluded that the high survival rate observed suggested that the diets used for rearing the larvae and maintaining the adults were appropriate. Also, the data adjusted to robust generalized linear models and there were no interruptions of O. albuquerquei pupae development within the limits of temperatures studied in southern Rio Grande do Sul, given the high survival presented."

Various studies describe the distribution of macroinvertebrate communities and their relationship with environmental factors at different geographical scales, but only a few of these studies concentrate on Western European lowlands. Using Flanders as representative for the densely populated Western-European lowlands, the specific aims of this study are: (i) to identify the different trichopteran species assemblages and to characterise them biologically using indicator species; (ii) to determine which environmental gradients most influence the observed species assemblages; and (iii) to analyse the relative importance of different spatial scale variables in constraining the Trichoptera distributions. Assessment of the main environmental gradients suggested that the absence of Trichoptera from certain locations was mainly due to elevated nutrient concentrations and lower oxygen contents, confirming their sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance. Five Trichoptera species assemblages were distinguished based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity coefficients. These assemblages did not differ significantly in species richness, but a shift in stream zonation preference was observed. In the ordination analysis 11 variables that were selected using a stepwise model building function manifested themselves as upstream-downstream and size-related gradients. The Trichoptera assemblages in lowland streams thus appear to follow a longitudinal succession pattern that corresponds with the species-specific preferences. Partitioning the variance over the different spatial scales indicated that the reach-scale variables were far more important in explaining the variation in species composition. The study design, which limited the minimum-maximum range of catchment-scale characteristics, however, may have led to an overestimation of the impact of the local-scale variables. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

This is especially true for Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), the major rice producer in Brazil, where no systematic surveys have been conducted. Thus, this work records preliminarily the species of suborder Terebrantia inhabitanting irrigated rice (RC) and three nearby habitats: the area selected for rice, before cultivation (BR), grassland (GR) and forest border (FB) in Cachoeirinha, RS (50\u00b058'21\" W; 29\u00b055'30\" S). Eight field trips were carried out between October/2004 and February/2005 to Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Experimental do Arroz in Cachoeirinha. Thrips specimens were collected with sweeping net and transported to laboratory for identification. A total of 623 adults terebrantians were recorded, belonging to two families and 18 species. Frankliniella rodeos (55.5%), Neohydatothrips cf. paraensis (30.3%) and Frankliniella schultzei (5.6%), were the most abundant, comprising more than 90% of the individuals. FB showed the highest species richness (S=15), followed by GR (S=10), RC (S=9) and BR (S=6). FB presented a low number of individuals (14.0%), contrasting with GR (44.8%) and BR (36.7%). In general, thrips abundance in RC was low at EEA (4.5%), and few species seems to effectively use rice as a host-plant. Two species previously considered of economic importance were found, F. rodeos and F. schultzei, the latter a new record for rice in Brazil. Five species are new records to RS."

Larvae of the coconut moth Atheloca subrufella (Hulst) develop in flowers and fruits of coconut, Cocos nucifera, causing precocious abscission of these structures and, hence, yield decrease. This work studied a feasible and suitable rearing technique for a. subrufella using fruits of coconut. We first determined the appropriate density of larvae to be reared per coconut fruit (among two, three, four or five larvae) and later tested the suitability of this rearing technique for three successive generations. The storage of egg and pupal stages during 0, 5, 10 and 20 days was also studied at 12\u00b0C. Based on the fertility life table parameters, the best results were achieved by rearing two or three larvae per fruit as they yielded the best net reproductive rate and intrinsic rate of population increase. In addition, eggs and pupae of a. subrufella can be stored at 12\u00b0C up to five days with viability higher than 90%. Adult moths emerged from pupae stored for five days at 12\u00b0C produced an average of 219.4 eggs and lived 18.8 days. Storage periods for eggs and pupae over 10 days significantly reduced egg viability and adult fecundity, respectively. Thus, the technique in here described was shown to be suitable for the continuous rearing of a. subrufella in laboratory conditions. \u00a9 2011 Sociedade Entomol\u00f3gica do Brasil."

Field investigations were conducted to determine the biotic and abiotic factors affecting the mate-locating behaviour of male L. phlaeas. Patrolling was often observed when light intensity was high. Perching was performed throughout the day regardless of environmental conditions, but the chasing of passing insects increased at high light intensities. The activity patterns of the males were not affected by those of the females. The thoracic temperatures of patrolling males were lower than those of perching males under cool conditions, suggesting that patrolling males lose heat more easily. In contrast, perching males may more easily regulate their body temperature to a suitable level as they fly for shorter periods and can bask while waiting for mates. These results highlight several reasons (i.e., heat loss, energetic costs) why males patrol when weather conditions are favourable. \u00a9 2003 Institute of Entomology."

A small white species, Appias (Catophaga) mariana Yata & Chainey sp.n., is described as new from the Marianas. Four other taxa, A. (C.) athama (Blanchard), A. (C.) galba (Wallace) stat.rev., A. (C.) galene (Felder & Felder) and A. (C.) wardii (Moore), treated in most recent literature as subspecies, are recognized here as distinct, increasing the number of Catophaga species generally recognized from nine to 15. A brief review is given for each, with notes on their diagnosis, general distribution and known hostplants. An annotated synonymic checklist indicating subspecies, type localities and four new synonyms, and nine lectotype designations, one neotype designation and two type locality restrictions necessary to stabilize usage conclude the paper. Online Supporting Information provides an extensive discussion concerning the possible evolution of these butterflies with respect to polymorphism, speciation, coloration and hostplant relationships, a comprehensive list of type material for all available species group names belonging to the subgenus, and a complete bibliography for all citations in both the printed and online material. \u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Although the species is highly protected and often red-listed little is known about its ecological requirements and status of its populations. Therefore, our main aims were to review its current and historical distributions and status of C. cinnaberinus populations in Europe and to determine its recent habitat preferences at the landscape level in the Czech Republic, where the increasing number of records over the last few years indicates a possible increase in abundance of this beetle. Cucujus cinnaberinus is closely associated with soft-wood and broad leaved trees and is able to colonize man-made habitats from persisting local populations if there is a sufficient supply of suitable dead wood. This beetle is not restricted to old-growth forests or even relict woodland, as previously reported, but currently predominantly inhabits abandoned planted stands of trees like lignicultures or avenues, which have an open canopy. Colonization of stands dominated by hybrid poplars probably resulted in the recent increase in the number of records of this species in the central European countries. However, this could present problems for the protection of this species in future, because the trees in these stands are gradually dying and are not being replaced. The decline and extinction of C. cinnaberinus on the northern and southern edges of its distribution was probably caused by the absence of soft-wooded broadleaved trees in intensively managed forests and other more suitable habitats. \u00a9 2003 Institute of Entomology."

Method: His work, the testimony of colleagues who treated him, and data obtained from his close relatives, as well as our own personal knowledge, are reviewed. Result: Baltasar Llopis was born in Valencia, and obtained his degree and doctorate in Medicine at the Valencia University. He specialized in urology with Dr. Tramoyeres Cases, for whom he acted as assistant surgeon and with whom he shared work at La Fe Hospital, where he carried out his complete urological activity, since its inception. Dr. Llopis opted for oncological research, with a special focus on urothelial tumors. He pioneered diagnosis of these tumors using tumor markers and the study of prognostic factors to assess the individual risk of relapse and to implement a specific chemotherapeutic treatment, which he introduced in clinical practice at La Fe Hospital. He thus demonstrated the two essential components of his personality, his investigative and human sides. Conclusion: A multi-faceted person with great skills and intelligence, Dr. Llopis eagerly devoted himself to research aimed at understanding the biological behavior of cancer, particularly urothelial tumors. In the early 80s he pioneered worldwide the development of specific markers, estimations of individual oncological risk, and prognostic factors useful for planning treatment. He was 20 years ahead of the era of predictive nomograms and their clinical Introduction In addition to being a forerunner of computing applications in Urology, he designed a database for registration of superficial bladder tumors, which allowed him to perform statistical and multivariate analyses using multiple regression models to predict the risk of relapse. \u00a9 2009 AEU.

One of these populations has been reared under laboratory conditions by 25 years without introduction of wild flies (Lab-pop), while the other has been maintained under the same conditions by 15 years but with occasional introduction of wild specimens (Hybrid-pop). The following parameters were analyzed: emergence percentage, life cycle duration (from eclosion to emergence), adult size, longevity, female fecundity and oviposition preference. The best performance of immatures of both populations was obtained on papaya as a host. Larvae reared on orange had longer life cycle, low emergence percentage and smaller adults. The fruit type did not affect fecundity and longevity of the Lab-pop, but in the Hybrid-pop males lived longer when reared on papaya, while females had higher longevity and fecundity when reared on orange. Females of both populations preferred to lay eggs in papaya (better host for larvae) when compared to orange. However, some eggs were deposited on orange only by females of Lab-pop, suggesting a lower ability for host selection of this population. These data are discussed regarding to the effects of continuous laboratory rearing on the biological parameters of this species."

            "text": "The field of stored-product entomology deals with insect pests of raw and processed cereals, pulses, seeds, spices, dried fruit and nuts, and other dry, durable commodities. These pests cause significant quantitative and qualitative losses to the multibillion dollar grain, food, and retail industries each year through their feeding, product adulteration, customer complaints, product rejection at the time of sale, and cost associated with their management. The reduction in the number of stored-product entomologists at a time when regulations are reducing the number of chemicals available to manage stored-product insect pests is making full use of the literature on stored-product insects more important. Use of nonchemical and reduced-risk pest management methods requires a greater understanding of pest biology, behavior, ecology, and susceptibility to pest management methods. Stored-product entomology courses have been or are currently offered at land grant universities in four states in the United States and in at least nine other countries. Stored-product and urban entomology books cover the largest total numbers of stored-product insect species (100-160 and 24-120, respectively); economic entomology books (17-34), and popular articles or extension Web sites (29-52) cover fewer numbers of stored-product insect species. A review of 582 popular articles, 182 extension bulletins, and 226 extension Web sites showed that some aspects of stored-product entomology are covered better than others. For example, articles and Web sites on trapping (4.6%) and detection (3.3%) were more common than those on sampling commodities (0.6%). Natural enemies and biological control together were the subjects of only 2.6% of articles and Web sites. Locating and eliminating the source populations may be one of the least expensive and most productive components of an insect pest management program, yet sources of insect infestations were the subject of only 1.2% of articles and Web sites. Insect biology is often oversimplified in popular articles and Web sites; for example, developmental times are often characterized by a single number giving the typical number of days required to complete development from egg to adult, instead of describing how developmental times vary with temperature. Literature is available on the effects of temperature and other environmental factors on the developmental times of 106 species of stored-product insects. This article provides insights into the extent to which stored-product insects are covered in entomology books, entomology courses, popular articles, and extension bulletins and Web sites. Stored-product entomology books and courses are important because the coverage of stored-product insects is limited in urban and other entomology books and courses. In addition to failing to provide training on managing stored-product insect pests, the limited coverage of stored-product insects in many entomology books suggests to students that they are of less economic importance than is the case. We hope that this paper will encourage and facilitate more extensive coverage of storedproduct insects in entomology books and courses, popular literature, and Web sites to meet the pest management needs of the grain, food processing, retail, and pest management industries. \u00a9 2018 Oxford University Press."

            "text": "Forensic entomology uses biological and ecological aspects of necrophagous insects to help in criminal investigations to estimate the post-mortem interval (PMI) or to determine the cause of death. Recent papers demonstrated that the presence of toxins in decomposing tissues may alter the insect developmental rate of insects exploiting such tissues as food. Thus, preliminary tests with artificial diets in laboratory are necessary to create a database to investigate and quantify the modifications that can occur with the collected insects from a criminal scene, avoiding any errors on the PMI estimates. The present study aimed to evaluate the developmental rate of Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) reared on: a) artificial diets containing animal tissues: bovine liver (D1), raw muscle (D2), stomach (D3), and chicken heart (D4); b) artificial diet without animal tissue (D5); and c) a control group (C), which had only meat. The efficiency of each substrate was assessed by immature weight gain (mg), larval developmental time, larval and pupal survival, emergence interval and adult size. D1 to D4 diets did not restrict C. albiceps development; however, larvae reared on D1 and D2 diets presented a lower adult emergence rate. D3 and control group showed similarities regarding the efficiency parameters (rate and emergence interval). Thus, the use of diet D3, artificial diet with stomach, is the most recommended."

Many ABDs are expected to increase in prevalence as a result of changing social habits, habitat modifications, introductions of exotic vectors and climate change. Control has, historically, focused on the use of insecticides and chemotherapy. We review alternative, emerging approaches to ABDs that currently offer promise, particularly modelling and molecular techniques and the development of novel vaccines that target molecules produced by arthropods during the bloodmeal. We argue that there is an urgent need to establish effective surveillance systems for most ABDs across various countries in order to facilitate a detailed risk analysis, which should include evaluation of potential spread to new areas and the possible introduction of new exotic species or disease agents. This will require clear and exhaustive knowledge on the distribution of ABDs in different areas, understanding of the diagnostic limitations pertaining to ABDs and standardization of techniques among reference laboratories in different countries. Continuous monitoring of insecticide resistance and the development of management strategies to minimize its onset are also essential. Ultimately, it is probable that approaches which attempt to reduce vector abundance or treat hosts with chemotherapy alone are unlikely to be effective in the long term. More suitable approaches may include greater use of a range of mutually compatible options in integrated management programmes. \u00a9 2008 The Authors."

With additional data for the development of the immature stages, life-fecundity tables were constructed and some population parameters calculated. The average total fecundities of N. includens at the above temperatures were 49.2, 97.8, 162.8, 108.5, 87.4 and 31.1 eggs/female, and average longevities 99.5, 84.7, 69.5, 61.1, 49.6 and 30.1 days, respectively. The net reproductive rates (R0) were 8.0, 32.2, 60.7, 32.6, 20.7 and 2.6 females/female, and the intrinsic rates of increase (rm) 0.014, 0.041, 0.083, 0.086, 0.077 and 0.024 females/female/day, respectively. The average total fecundities of N. bisignatus at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 32.5 \u00bfC were 54.7, 72.1, 96.9, 56.0 and 22.8 eggs/female, and average longevities 116.1, 108.7, 71.8, 68.8 and 43.7 days, respectively. The net reproductive rates (R0) were 13.9, 26.4, 31.3, 15.2 and 3.6 females/female and the intrinsic rates of increase (rm) were 0.017, 0.035, 0.060, 0.051 and 0.024 females/female/day, respectively. The survival of females at each temperature was fitted using a Weibull distribution [S(t) = e-( b/t)c]. Furthermore two mathematical models [Enkegaard equation: F = (a + b + x) \u00b7 e(c+d-x), Analytis equation: F = a \u00b7 (x-xmin)n. (xmin - x)m] were fitted to the fecundity data."

The aim of this study was to find out the potency of Erionota thrax to spread Blood Disease Bacterium the causal agent of banana blood disease in Indonesia. A field survey was conducted to record the existance of Blood Disease Bacterium in larvae and adult E. thrax. The results show that Blood Disease Bacterium was not found in the larval stage of E. thrax. In the adult of E. thrax, the pathogen was found on the legs, wings, body surface, head and head surface, but it was not found inside the body of E. thrax. \u00a9 2006, University of Lampung Faculty of Agriculture.

Three diets were tested and compared with the natural diet privet [soybean and peanut seeds and privet Ligustrum lucidum Ait. fruit (Oleaceae)]. All three artificial diets allowed full development. The diet containing sunflower oil was the most suitable for N. viridula while E. heros developed better on a diet composed of soybean oil. Data indicated that the artificial diets were inferior to the natural diet. The artificial diets were more adequate for E. heros."

To meet a growing biological demand and to compensate a decreasing workforce amount, automated entomology has been around for decades. This challenge has been tackled by computer scientists as well as by biologists themselves. This survey investigates fourty-four studies on this topic and tries to give a global picture on what are the scientific locks and how the problem was addressed. Views are adopted on image capture, feature extraction, classification methods and the tested datasets. A general discussion is finally given on the questions that might still remain unsolved such as: the image capture conditions mandatory to good recognition performance, the definition of the problem and whether computer scientist should consider it as a problem in its own or just as an instance of a wider image recognition problem. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

It is used daily by public health leaders, government officials at all levels, physicians, veterinarians and other healthcare workers, researchers, private companies, journalists and the general public. Reports are produced and commentary provided by a global team of subject matter experts in a variety of fields including virology, parasitology, epidemiology, entomology, veterinary and plant disease specialists. ProMED operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and has over 83 000 subscribers, representing every country in the world. Additionally, ProMED disseminates information via its website and through social media channels such as Twitter and Facebook as well as through RSS feeds. Over the last 22 years, it has been the first to report on numerous major and minor disease outbreaks including SARS, MERS, Ebola and the early spread of Zika. ProMED is transparent, apolitical, open to all and free of charge, making it an important and longstanding contributor to global health surveillance. \u00a9 The Author 2017.

            "text": "Correct identification of forensically important insects, such as flies in the family Calliphoridae, is a crucial step for them to be used as evidence in legal investigations. Traditional identification based on morphology has been effective, but has some limitations when it comes to identifying immature stages of certain species. DNAbarcoding, using COI, has demonstrated potential for rapid and accurate identification of Calliphoridae, however, this gene does not reliably distinguish among some recently diverged species, raising questions about its use for delimitation of species of forensic importance. To facilitateDNAbased identification of Calliphoridae in the Caribbean we developed a vouchered reference collection from across the region, and a DNA sequence database, and further added the nuclear ITS2 as a second marker to increase accuracy of identification through barcoding. We morphologically identified freshly collected specimens, did phylogenetic analyses and employed several species delimitation methods for a total of 468 individuals representing 19 described species. Our results show that combination of COI + ITS2 genes yields more accurate identification and diagnoses, and better agreement with morphological data, than the mitochondrial barcodes alone. All of our results from independent and concatenated trees and most of the species delimitation methods yield considerably higher diversity estimates than the distance based approach and morphology. Molecular data support at least 24 distinct clades within Calliphoridae in this study, recovering substantial geographic variation for Lucilia eximia, Lucilia retroversa, Lucilia rica and Chloroprocta idioidea, probably indicating several cryptic species. In sum, our study demonstrates the importance of employing a second nuclear marker for barcoding analyses and species delimitation of calliphorids, and the power of molecular data in combination with a complete reference database to enable identification of taxonomically and geographically diverse insects of forensic importance. \u00a9 2017 Yusseff-Vanegas and Agnarsson."

They are well known for diversified species and habitats, but in the context of forensic entomology, scuttle flies\u2019 inhabitance of corpses remains inadequately explored. With recent reports indicating the existence of more scuttle fly species possibly inhabiting these environments, a decomposition study using animal carcasses in enclosed environments was conducted. The aim was to record the occurrence of scuttle flies on rabbit carcasses placed in sealed plastic waste bins for a 40-day period. The study was conducted as two replicates in Bangi, Selangor. Sampling was carried out at different time intervals inside a modified mosquito net as a trap. Inside the trap, adult scuttle flies were aspirated and preserved in 70% ethanol. The fly larvae and pupae were reared until their adult stage to facilitate identification. From this study, six scuttle fly species were collected, i.e., Dahliphora sigmoides (Schmitz) \u2642, Gymnoptera simplex (Brues) \u2640, Megaselia scalaris (Loew) \u2642\u2640, Puliciphora borinquenensis (Wheeler) \u2642, Puliciphora obtecta Meijere \u2640 and Spiniphora sp. \u2640. Both D. sigmoides and P. obtecta were newly recorded in Malaysia, whilst the Spiniphora sp. was considered an unknown species until it was linked to its male counterpart. The sealed waste bins were found to be accessible for the scuttle flies with delayed arrival (day 4\u20135). Megaselia scalaris was the primary scuttle fly species attracted to the carcass, and its occurrence could be observed between days 4\u20137 (replicate 1) and days 5\u201333 (replicate 2). This study also revealed Sarcophaga spp. (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) as the earliest species to colonize the remains and the longest to inhabit them (days 2\u201340). The larvae of Hermetia illucens (Linneaus) (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) and Fannia sp. (Diptera: Fanniidae) were found on the carcasses during the mid-advanced decay period. These findings expand the knowledge on the diversity of forensically important scuttle flies and coexisting dipterans in enclosed environments in Malaysia. \u00a9 Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017."

The main country event was well-planned and coordinated by the National Programme for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control (CNM), and included key contributions from high-ranking political figures, such as His Excellency (H.E) Mam Bun Heng (Minister of Health), and H.E. Keut Sothea (Governor of Pailin Province). There were more than 1000 attendees, ranging from Village Malaria Workers and high school students to CNM's director and other officials in Pailin Province, Western Cambodia. A strong inter-sectoral participation included attendances from the Ministry of Education and high-level representatives of the Cambodian Armed Forces, as well as Malaria Partners like the World Health Organization. \u00a9 2016 The Author(s)."

However, developmental rates differ locally, so that estimates should be based on regionally generated development data. Therefore, we determined the developmental rates of C. rufifacies within its native range in Thailand under nine constant temperature regimes: 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36 and 39 \u00b0C. Developmental times from egg to adult varied among the temperatures and were longest at 15 \u00b0C (618 h) and shortest at 33 \u00b0C (168 h). No pupae emerged at 39 \u00b0C. We used linear regression models to estimate the minimum development threshold temperatures for each life stage: egg stage = 9.5 \u00b0C, first to second instar = 10.8 \u00b0C, second to third instar = 11.5 \u00b0C, third instar to pupariation = 11.4 \u00b0C, pupariation to adults = 5.0 \u00b0C; the minimum threshold to complete all larvae stages was 11.1 \u00b0C and to complete all life stages from eggs to adult was 9.5 \u00b0C. We further generated isomorphen and isomegalen diagrams that can be used to quickly estimate the PMImin for forensic applications. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Mass production of mosquitoes for large-scale releases demands a huge amount of water. Yet, many arid and/or seasonally arid countries face the difficulties of acute water shortage, deterioration of water quality and environmental constraints. The re-use of water to rear successive generations of larvae is attractive as a way to reduce water usage and running costs, and help to make this control method viable. Methods: To determine whether dirty larval water was a suitable rearing medium for Anopheles arabiensis, in place of the 'clean' dechlorinated water routinely used, a series of three experiments was carried out to evaluate the effect of dirty water or mixed clean and dirty water on several parameters of insect quality. Batches of 100 fresh eggs were distributed in dirty water or added to clean water to test the effect of dirty water on egg hatching, whereas first-instar larvae were used to determine the effect on immature development time, pupation, adult emergence, body size, and longevity. Moreover, to assess the effect of dirty water on larval mortality, pupation rate, adult emergence, and longevity, L4 larvae collected after the tilting or larvae/pupae separation events were returned either to the dirty water or added to clean water. Results: Results indicated that reusing dirty water or using a 50:50 mix of clean and dirty water did not affect egg hatching. Moreover, no difference was found in time to pupation, larval mortality or sex ratio when first-instar larvae were added to clean water, dirty water, or a 75:25, 50:50 or 25:75 mix of clean and dirty water and reared until emergence. When late-instar larvae were put back into their own rearing water, there was no effect on pupation rate, emergence rate or female longevity, though male longevity was reduced. When reared from first-instar larvae, however, dirty water decreased pupation rate, emergence rate, body size, and adult longevity. Conclusions: Re-used larval-rearing water has no impact on egg hatching, development time or mortality of the immature stages of An. arabiensis. However, dirty water is not suitable for the production of high quality adult mosquitoes. Recycling processes to improve water quality and increase insect quality will be investigated, since it may have important implications for the implementation of the SIT in areas where clean water is a scarce or costly resource. \u00a9 2016 Mamai et al."

Separate chapters in this book are devoted to Importance of Acarology, Historical account, acarine technology, morphology and anatomy of Acari; Feeding, Development and Reproduction. Molecular developments in relation to mites and ticks are also discussed. Role of mites and ticks in Quarantines of plants and animals; forensic/criminal investigations; and importance of accidental acarophagy are discussed in detail. Safe usage of pesticides based on their mode of action (IRAC\u2019s Groups), development of acaricide resistance and measures to mitigate it are discussed. Mite pests of fruit trees, vegetable plants, and floricultural plants; field crops; mite problems in greenhouses/polyhouses; and mite problems encountered under organic cultivation of plants; and their management through minimum usage of pesticides are emphasized. Role of different predaceous mites in controlling plant pests like thrips, aphids and scale insects is elaborately discussed. Biological control of phytophagous mites is discussed in detail. Different animal parasitic mites and ticks are discussed from veterinary and medical point of view. At the end of each chapter, many important references for further reading; and Electronic References (ER) in the form of youtube links and other weblinks are given to understand fully how these tiny creatures look like; behave, feed and reproduce; nature of damage they cause to plants and animals; and measures to mitigate them. Weblinks will stimulate interest in the readers for more information about different mites and ticks. The knowledge contained in the book may prove as best material for \u201cGeneral and Applied Acarology\u201d course for graduate and post-graduate levels, teachers and researchers in entomology, pest control advisors, professional entomologists, pesticide industry managers, policy planners, and others having interest in mites and ticks. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016."

It is important to choose a suitable model to predict outbreaks of pest insects under climate change. However, previous comparisons among these models were usually based on a single species. In the present study, we compared the six nonlinear models (the Bri\u00e9re-1, Bri\u00e9re-2, Lactin, Performance-2, beta, and Ratkowsky models) based on the goodness of fit and the trade-off between the model's goodness of fit and structural complexity, using 10 temperaturedependent developmental rate datasets on insects to make the conclusions general. We found that the square root model (i.e., the Ratkowsky model) fitted all datasets well, and the curve shape produced by this model also approximates the curve shape of thermodynamically based mathematical models. The square root model was originally derived to be applicable to the growth rates of bacteria, and until now it has been generally ignored in entomology. We were mainly concerned with the predicted results obtained by using this model on observations of temperature-dependent developmental rates. We found that the square root model described well the pooled developmental rates in the low-, mid-, and high-temperature ranges, and we believe that it merits wider use in entomology. \u00a9 The Authors 2015."

The body mass of the mature larvae, after they abandoned the diet, were recorded in batches of five. The variation between the mean body mass of larvae and the duration of larval and pupal stages, and overall duration of the development, viability and normal rates were analyzed by ANOVA. There were no significant differences between the four treatments in the following parameters: body mass of larvae that discontinued the diet as well as the duration of larval, pupal, and total development. The sex ratios found in the four treatments did not differ from those expected. Normality rates were 100% for all treatments. There were no significant differences between treatments for larval and overall viability, but pupal viability differed significantly between T1 and the control, T1 and T2, and between the control and T3.

However, data in the literature provide contradictory information for the identification of third instar larvae of these species. This hinders easy species differentiation because it requires the rearing of material to adult stages in order to facilitate reliable identification. Third instar larvae of these three Muscina species were studied in detail using light and scanning electron microscopy to provide thorough redescriptions of their morphology. Existing information concerning third instar morphology, with particular reference to its value for taxonomy and identification, is revised and discussed. Emden's spiracular distance factor (SDF) is considered here as inappropriate for identification purposes in third instar larvae of Muscina spp. because its values are not constant ratios but increase during larval maturation and overlap in the examined species. These species were, instead, discriminated here by differences in the spinulation patterns of their abdominal segments. \u00a9 2015 The Royal Entomological Society."

            "text": "Abstract Background: The response of Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) to artificial light sources has led to the use of light-suction traps in surveillance programmes. Recent integration of light emitting diodes (LED) in traps improves flexibility in trapping through reduced power requirements and also allows the wavelength of light used for trapping to be customized. This study investigates the responses of Culicoides to LED light-suction traps emitting different wavelengths of light to make recommendations for use in surveillance. Methods: The abundance and diversity of Culicoides collected using commercially available traps fitted with Light Emitting Diode (LED) platforms emitting ultraviolet (UV) (390 nm wavelength), blue (430 nm), green (570 nm), yellow (590 nm), red (660 nm) or white light (425 nm - 750 nm with peaks at 450 nm and 580 nm) were compared. A Centre for Disease Control (CDC) UV light-suction trap was also included within the experimental design which was fitted with a 4 watt UV tube (320-420 nm). Generalised linear models with negative binomial error structure and log-link function were used to compare trap abundance according to LED colour, meteorological conditions and seasonality. Results: The experiment was conducted over 49 nights with 42,766 Culicoides caught in 329 collections. Culicoides obsoletus Meigen and Culicoides scoticus Downes and Kettle responded indiscriminately to all wavelengths of LED used with the exception of red which was significantly less attractive. In contrast, Culicoides dewulfi Goetghebuer and Culicoides pulicaris Linnaeus were found in significantly greater numbers in the green LED trap than in the UV LED trap. The LED traps collected significantly fewer Culicoides than the standard CDC UV light-suction trap. Conclusions: Catches of Culicoides were reduced in LED traps when compared to the standard CDC UV trap, however, their reduced power requirement and small size fulfils a requirement for trapping in logistically challenging areas or where many traps are deployed at a single site. Future work should combine light wavelengths to improve trapping sensitivity and potentially enable direct comparisons with collections from hosts, although this may ultimately require different forms of baits to be developed. \u00a9 2015 Hope et al."

            "text": "Background: Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a robust and accessible method to assay gene expression and to infer gene regulation. Being a chain of procedures, this technique is subject to systematic error due to biological and technical limitations mainly set by the starting material and downstream procedures. Thus, rigorous data normalization is critical to grant reliability and repeatability of gene expression quantification by qRT-PCR. A number of 'housekeeping genes', involved in basic cellular functions, have been commonly used as internal controls for this normalization process. However, these genes could themselves be regulated and must therefore be tested a priori. Methods: We evaluated eight potential reference genes for their stability as internal controls for RT-qPCR studies of olfactory gene expression in the antennae of Rhodnius prolixus, a Chagas disease vector. The set of genes included were: \u03b1-tubulin; \u03b2-actin; Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Eukaryotic initiation factor 1A; Glutathione-S-transferase; Serine protease; Succinate dehydrogenase; and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Five experimental conditions, including changes in age,developmental stage and feeding status were tested in both sexes. Results: We show that the evaluation of candidate reference genes is necessary for each combination of sex, tissue and physiological condition analyzed in order to avoid inconsistent results and conclusions. Although, Normfinder and geNorm software yielded different results between males and females, five genes (SDH, Tub, GAPDH, Act and G6PDH) appeared in the first positions in all rankings obtained. By using gene expression data of a single olfactory coreceptor gene as an example, we demonstrated the extent of changes expected using different internal standards. Conclusions: This work underlines the need for a rigorous selection of internal standards to grant the reliability of normalization processes in qRT-PCR studies. Furthermore, we show that particular physiological or developmental conditions require independent evaluation of a diverse set of potential reference genes. \u00a9 2015 Omondi et al.; licensee BioMed Central."

Emerson Entomology Museum, Oklahoma State University, were reviewed. In addition, dry ice traps and tick drags were used to collect adult and nymphal A. americanum from throughout the state. Review of published USDA reports and the local museum collection documented A. americanum in 49 total counties (35 and 35, respectively). Active surveillance efforts confirmed the presence of this tick in 50 counties from which this species had not been previously reported to be established, documenting A. americanum is established in 68 of the 77 (88.3%) counties in Oklahoma. Taken together, these data verify that A. americanum ticks are much more widespread in Oklahoma than reflected in the literature, a phenomenon likely repeated throughout the geographic range of this tick in the eastern half of North America. \u00a9 The Author 2015."

In particular, they have been colonized under laboratory conditions to study their medical relevance. Laboratory colonization of these bugs is a multifactorial phenomenon. Our goal was to conduct a comparative literature review to classify the published data, demonstrating preferred bed bug colony conditions. We show that physical factors including temperature, relative humidity and photoperiod, and physiological factors such as type and frequency of blood meals play important roles in laboratory colonies. Any change in these factors produces changes in life-cycle duration. Temperature and blood meal are the most important factors, with a marked impact on the life-cycle of laboratory populations, depending on the species. A wide range of temperatures (15-34 \u00b0C) and relative humidity (46-75%) with an average of 25 \u00b0C and 59% were found for these colonies. Two widely used blood sources for the colonies were rabbits and humans. \u00a9 A. Cannet et al., published by EDP Sciences, 2015."

The database includes 32,025 total records and 19,000 unique records for 106 species of dragonflies and damselflies, with records spanning 1879\u20132013. Records have been geographically referenced using the point-radius method to assign coordinates and an uncertainty radius to specimen locations. In addition to describing techniques used in data acquisition, georeferencing, and quality control, we present assessments of the temporal, spatial, and taxonomic distribution of records. We use this information to identify biases in the data, and to determine changes in species prevalence, latitudinal ranges, and elevation ranges when comparing records before 1976 and after 1979. The average latitude of where records occurred increased by 78 km over these time periods. While average elevation did not change significantly, the average minimum elevation across species declined by 108 m. Odonata distribution may be generally shifting northwards as temperature warms and to lower minimum elevations in response to increased summer water availability in low-elevation agricultural regions. The unexpected decline in elevation may also be partially the result of bias in recent collections towards centers of human population, which tend to occur at lower elevations. This study emphasizes the need to address temporal, spatial, and taxonomic biases in museum and observational records in order to produce reliable conclusions from such data. \u00a9 Joan E.

The aim of this study was to obtain the types of insects on pig carcasses that could be used for the estimation of post-mortem interval. Methods: Four domestic pigs sacrificed with different methods were used as a model. The carcasses were observed twice daily (around 9 a.m and 4 p.m) during 15 days to assess the stages of decomposition and to collect insects, both in mature and immature stages. The immature insects were reared and the mature insects were indentified in the Laboratory of Pests and Plant Diseases, University of Sam Ratulangi, Manado. Chrysomya megacephala and C. rufifacies were identified both morphologically and with deoxyribose-nucleic acid (DNA) techniques. Results: Five stages of decomposition (fresh, bloated, active decay, post-decay, and skeletonization) were observed. A total of 11 Diptera and 8 Coleoptera species were found during a 15-days succession study. Chrysomya megacephala, C. rufifacies and Hermetia illucens colonized in all carcasses. Conclusion: Insects found on four different pig carcasses consisted mainly of widespread Diptera and Coleoptera. Chrysomya megacephala, C. rufifacies and Hermetia illucens seemed to be primary candidates for the estimation of the post-mortem interval. \u00a9 2015 Authors."

            "text": "Background: The Plasmodium falciparum entomological inoculation rate (PfEIR) is a measure of exposure to infectious mosquitoes. It is usually interpreted as the number of P. falciparum infective bites received by an individual during a season or annually (aPfEIR). In an area of perennial transmission, the accuracy, precision and seasonal distribution (i.e., month by month) of aPfEIR were investigated. Data were drawn from three sites in Uganda with differing levels of transmission where falciparum malaria is transmitted mainly by Anopheles gambiae s.l. Estimates of aPfEIR derived from human-landing catches - the classic method for estimating biting rates - were compared with data from CDC light traps, and with catches of knock down and exit traps separately and combined. Methods. Entomological surveillance was carried out over one year in 2011/12 in three settings: Jinja, a peri-urban area with low transmission; Kanungu, a rural area with moderate transmission; and Nagongera, Tororo District, a rural area with exceptionally high malaria transmission. Three sampling approaches were used from randomly selected houses with collections occurring once a month: human-landing collections (eight houses), CDC light traps (100 houses) and paired knock-down and exit traps each month (ten houses) for each setting. Up to 50 mosquitoes per month from each household were tested for sporozoites with P. falciparum by ELISA. Human biting rate (HBR) data were estimated month by month. P. falciparum Sporozoite rate (PfSR) for yearly and monthly data and confidence intervals were estimated using the binomial exact test. Monthly and yearly estimates of the HBR, the PfSR, and the PfEIR were estimated and compared. Results: The estimated aPfEIR values using human-landing catch data were 3.8 (95% Confidence Intervals, CI 0-11.4) for Jinja, 26.6 (95% CI 7.6-49.4) for Kanungu, and 125 (95% CI 72.2-183.0) for Tororo. In general, the monthly PfEIR values showed strong seasonal signals with two peaks from May-June and October-December, although the precise timing of the peaks differed between sites. Estimated HBRs using human-landing catches were strongly correlated with those made using CDC light traps (r2 = 0.67, p < 0.001), and with either knock-down catches (r2 = 0.56, p < 0.001) and exit traps (r2 = 0.82, p < 0.001) or the combined catches (r2 = 0.73, p < 0.001). Using CDC light trap catch data, the PfSR in Tororo was strongly negatively correlated with monthly HBR (r 2 = 0.44, p = 0.01). In other sites, no patterns in the PfSR were discernible because either the number P. falciparum of sporozoite positive mosquitoes or the total number of mosquitoes caught was too low. Conclusions: In these settings, light traps provide an alternative method for sampling indoor-resting mosquitoes to human-landing catches and have the advantage that they protect individuals from being bitten during collection, are easy to use and are not subject to collector bias. Knock-down catches and exit traps could also be used to replace human-landing catches. Although these are cheaper, they are subject to collector bias. \u00a9 2014 Kilama et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "Background: Monitoring mosquito population dynamics is essential to guide selection and evaluation of malaria vector control interventions but is typically implemented by mobile, centrally-managed teams who can only visit a limited number of locations frequently enough to capture longitudinal trends. Community-based (CB) mosquito trapping schemes for parallel, continuous monitoring of multiple locations are therefore required that are practical, affordable, effective, and reliable. Methods. A CB surveillance scheme, with a monthly sampling and reporting cycle for capturing malaria vectors, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps (LT) and Ifakara Tent Traps (ITT), were conducted by trained community health workers (CHW) in 14 clusters of households immediately surrounding health facilities in rural south-east Zambia. At the end of the study, a controlled quality assurance (QA) survey was conducted by a centrally supervised expert team using human landing catch (HLC), LT and ITT to evaluate accuracy of the CB trapping data. Active surveillance of malaria parasite infection rates amongst humans was conducted by CHWs in the same clusters to determine the epidemiological relevance of these CB entomological surveys. Results: CB-LT and CB-ITT exhibited relative sampling efficiencies of 50 and 7%, respectively, compared with QA surveys using the same traps. However, cost per sampling night was lowest for CB-LT ($13.6), followed closely by CB-ITT ($18.0), both of which were far less expensive than any QA survey (HLC: $138, LT: $289, ITT: $269). Cost per specimen of Anopheles funestus captured was lowest for CB-LT ($5.3), followed by potentially hazardous QA-HLC ($10.5) and then CB-ITT ($28.0), all of which were far more cost-effective than QA-LT ($141) and QA-ITT ($168). Time-trends of malaria diagnostic positivity (DP) followed those of An. funestus density with a one-month lag and the wide range of mean DP across clusters was closely associated with mean densities of An. funestus caught by CB-LT (P < 0.001). Conclusions: CB trapping schemes appear to be far more affordable, epidemiologically relevant and cost-effective than centrally supervised trapping schemes and may well be applicable to enhance intervention trials and even enable routine programmatic monitoring of vector population dynamics on unprecedented national scales. \u00a9 2014 Sikaala et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "Physiological responses to transient conditions may result in costly responses with little fitness benefits, and therefore, a trade-off must exist between the speed of response and the duration of exposure to new conditions. Here, using the puparia of an important insect disease vector, Glossina\u00a0pallidipes, we examine this potential trade-off using a novel combination of an experimental approach and a population dynamics model. Specifically, we explore and dissect the interactions between plastic physiological responses, treatment-duration and -intensity using an experimental approach. We then integrate these experimental results from organismal water-balance data and their plastic responses into a population dynamics model to examine the potential relative fitness effects of simulated transient weather conditions on population growth rates. The results show evidence for the predicted trade-off for plasticity of water loss rate (WLR) and the duration of new environmental conditions. When altered environmental conditions lasted for longer durations, physiological responses could match the new environmental conditions, and this resulted in a lower WLR and lower rates of population decline. At shorter time-scales however, a mismatch between acclimation duration and physiological responses was reflected by reduced overall population growth rates. This may indicate a potential fitness cost due to insufficient time for physiological adjustments to take place. The outcomes of this work therefore suggest plastic water balance responses have both costs and benefits, and these depend on the time-scale and magnitude of variation in environmental conditions. These results are significant for understanding the evolution of plastic physiological responses and changes in population abundance in the context of environmental variability. \u00a9 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."

Mercury thermometers and electrical temperature sensors have traditionally been used to record temperatures of maggot masses, cadavers and the surrounding soil and air. However, these techniques are limited to one measurement at a time and thus may not accurately describe the complexities of the thermal environment of the cadaver. Infrared imaging has gained increasing popularity because of its resolution, affordability and portability. Using decomposing pig carcasses, the current study showed that surface temperature measurements recorded using temperature loggers are able to be successfully replicated by taking spot measurements from an infrared image. Additionally, by recording the maximum temperature observed within each infrared image, an accurate proxy was achieved for internal temperatures of a carcass placed outdoors (R 2=0.46, p<0.001). By studying a pig in a temperature-controlled room and thus removing external environmental factors, the strength of the relationship between maximum infrared temperature and internal carcass temperatures was increased (R2=0.98, p<0.001). This successful characterisation of maggot mass temperatures within carcasses should encourage the application of infrared imaging in forensic entomology research and casework. \u00a9 2013 \u00a9 2013 Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences."

Postinvasion, native ant communities are often found to be depauperate, though the causes of this apparent lack of coexistence are rarely well known. Myrmica rubra (L.), a Palearctic Myrmecine ant, is currently expanding its range as an invasive in North America. This aggressive ant forms dense, patchy local infestations and appears to aggressively displace native ant fauna. We measured behavioral interactions and rates of recruitment in experimental field assays pitting native foragers against captive colonies of M. rubra at tuna-jelly or aphid baits in uninfested areas of Mt. Desert Island, ME. Behavioral interactions were idiosyncratic with respect to the native opponent, but M. rubra generally showed significantly higher levels of recruitment, aggression, and displacement of native foragers. As with other invasive ant species shown to have broken the \"dominance-discovery trade-off,\" M. rubra was consistently faster to discover baits and disproportionately displaced native foragers, providing a plausible proximate mechanism for native ant exclusion. Finally, we surveyed ant recruitment at baits for 24 h in August 2004 at four sites with varying M. rubra abundance but found little evidence of temporal niche partitioning. Taken together, these results indicate competitive superiority by M. rubra with respect to native ant communities of the northeastern North America and suggest direct aggression and competitive exclusion at food resources can lead to local native displacement. \u00a9 2014 Entomological Society of America."

However, poor nutritional quality or high prevalence of disease make this difficult because individuals either cannot acquire sufficient resources or must divert resources to other fitness-related traits such as immunity. Under such conditions, individuals are expected to mature later at a smaller body size and in poorer body condition. Moreover, the juvenile environment can also produce longer-term effects on adult fitness by causing shifts in resource allocation strategies that could alter investment in immune function and affect adult lifespan. We manipulated diet quality and immune status of juvenile Texas field crickets, Gryllus texensis, to investigate how poor developmental conditions affect sex-specific investment in fitness-related traits. As predicted, a poor juvenile diet was related to smaller mass and body size at eclosion in both sexes. However, our results also reveal sexually dimorphic responses to different facets of the rearing environment: female life history decisions are affected more by diet quality, whereas males are affected more by immune status. We suggest that females respond to decreased nutritional income because this threatens their ability to achieve a large adult body size, whereas male fitness is more dependent on reaching adulthood and so they invest in immunity and survival to eclosion. \u00a9 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."

            "text": "The Lygaeidae (sensu lato) are a highly successful family of true bugs found worldwide, yet many aspects of their ecology and evolution remain obscure or unknown. While a few species have attracted considerable attention as model species for the study of insect physiology, it is only relatively recently that biologists have begun to explore aspects of their behavior, life history evolution, and patterns of intra- and interspecific ecological interactions across more species. As a result though, a range of new phenotypes and opportunities for addressing current questions in evolutionary ecology has been uncovered. For example, researchers have revealed hitherto unexpectedly rich patterns of bacterial symbiosis, begun to explore the evolutionary function of the family's complex genitalia, and also found evidence of parthenogenesis. Here we review our current understanding of the biology and ecology of the group as a whole, focusing on several of the best-studied characteristics of the group, including aposematism (i.e., the evolution of warning coloration), chemical communication, sexual selection (especially, postcopulatory sexual selection), sexual conflict, and patterns of host-endosymbiont coevolution. Importantly, many of these aspects of lygaeid biology are likely to interact, offering new avenues for research, for instance into how the evolution of aposematism influences sexual selection. With the growing availability of genomic tools for previously \"non-model\" organisms, combined with the relative ease of keeping many of the polyphagous species in the laboratory, we argue that these bugs offer many opportunities for behavioral and evolutionary ecologists. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.

The cottony camellia scale, Pulvinaria floccifera (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Coccidae) is one of the most important pests of tea orchards in the north of Iran. Spatial distribution is an important item in entomoecology and needs to be studied for many pest management programs. So, weekly sampling of P. floccifera population was carried out throughout the 2008-2010 season, in the tea gardens of the Tonekabon region of the Mazandaran province of Iran. Each cut branch of tea was determined as a sample unit and after primary sampling, sample size was calculated using the equation: N = (ts/dm)2, (d = 0.15, sample size = 50). The data acquired were used to describe the spatial distribution pattern of P. floccifera by Tylor's power law, Iwao's mean crowding regression, Index of Dispersion (ID), and Index of Clumping (IDM). Tylor's power law (R2 > 0.84) and Iwao's mean crowding regression (R2 > 0.82) indicated that spatial distribution of 1st and 2nd nymphal instars is aggregated, but the distribution of 3rd instars, adults, and egg ovisacs is uniform. A result of ID and IDM showed that distribution of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instars, adults, and egg ovisacs were aggregative each time the sampling was done."

We therefore compared the relative attractiveness of shorter wavelength (SW) and longer wavelength (LW) lighting to macromoths. SW light attracted significantly more individuals and species of moth, either when used alone or in competition with LW lighting. We also found striking differences in the relative attractiveness of different wavelengths to different moth groups. SW lighting attracted significantly more Noctuidae than LW, whereas both wavelengths were equally attractive to Geometridae. Understanding the extent to which different groups of moth are attracted to different wavelengths of light will be useful in determining the impact of artificial light on moth populations."

To understand how the tick achieves both tasks, penetration and attachment, with the same set of implements, we recorded the insertion events by cinematography, interpreted the mouthparts' function by scanning electron microscopy and identified their points of articulation by confocal microscopy. Our structural dynamic observations suggest that the process of insertion and attachment occurs via a ratchet-like mechanism with two distinct stages. Initially, the two telescoping chelicerae pierce the skin and, by moving alternately, generate a toehold. Subsequently, a breaststroke-like motion, effected by simultaneous flexure and retraction of both chelicerae, pulls in the barbed hypostome. This combination of a flexible, dynamic mechanical ratchet and a static holdfast thus allows the tick to solve the problem of how to penetrate skin and also remain stuck for long periods of time. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The discovery of the nest-mate recognition system in Formica exsecta ants has allowed phenotypic variation in chemical profiles to be quantified across a natural population of 83 colonies. We investigated if this variation was correlated or not with intrinsic (genetic relatedness), extrinsic (location, light, temperature), or social (queen number) factors. (Z)-9-Alkenes and n-alkanes showed different patterns of variance: island (location) explained only 0.2 % of the variation in (Z)-9-alkenes, but 21-29 % in n-alkanes, whereas colony of origin explained 96 % and 45-49 % of the variation in (Z)-9-alkenes and n-alkanes, respectively. By contrast, within-colony variance of (Z)-9-alkenes was 4 %, and 23-34 % in n-alkanes, supporting the function of the former as recognition cues. (Z)-9-Alkene and n-alkane profiles were correlated with the genetic distance between colonies. Only n-alkane profiles diverged with increasing spatial distance. Sampling year explained a small (5 %), but significant, amount of the variation in the (Z)-9-alkenes, but there was no consistent directional trend. Polygynous colonies and populous monogynous colonies were dominated by a rich C23:1 profile. We found no associations between worker size, mound exposure, or humidity, although effect sizes for the latter two factors were considerable. The results support the conjecture that genetic factors are the most likely source of between-colony variation in cuticular hydrocarbons. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s)."

            "text": "A variety of traps have been developed for monitoring introduced populations of Pseudacteon spp. phorid flies (Diptera: Phoridae) across their established range in the United States. Such traps typically exploit common aspects of phorid fly biology and behavior, such as their attraction to live or dead red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), as well as the perching behavior of these parasitoids. However, populations of multiple species of phorid flies have been established in the United States to serve as biological control agents against S. invicta, and it is unclear if all trap designs are equally effective in sampling this variety of phorid species. This study investigated the effectiveness of six trap designs simultaneously during three sampling events in south- central Texas. Interactions between two species of phorid flies (Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier and P. curvatus B.) and their hosts have been intensively studied at this location for over eight years. When analyzed independently, there were no significant differences in the mean number of P. curvatus or P. tricuspis phorid s collected by any of the trap designs during any of the sampling events. However, when the total number of phorids collected were combined, significant trap performance differentials were observed during the October 2010 sampling event. Furthermore, there were significant differences among male flies during the September 2012 observation. Additionally, a trap component cost comparison is provided. The consistent and relatively equivalent performance of the phorid traps investigated in these trials suggests that all are appropriate for phorid surveillance, and cost and ease-of-use considerations may be the most important criteria when selecting a trap design. \u00a9 2013 Entomological Society of America."

We describe a hydrolysis probe analysis (Taqman assay) method for the rapid identification of these two clades. Findings. A total of 53 An. funestus s.s. from Malawi and Mozambique were tested for detection of clade types using the hydrolysis probe analysis. Results were compared to DNA sequence analysis to verify the accuracy of the probes Taqman assay for this vector species. Analysis using the hydrolysis probe revealed that there were 21 individuals from Malawi and 13 individuals from Mozambique for clade I, and 19 individuals from Mozambique for clade II. The results were consistent with the results of DNA sequences. A field sample from northern Zambia revealed the presence of both clade types. Conclusion: A diagnostic method using the hydrolysis probe analysis was developed to identify clade types within An. funestus s.s. This assay will be useful for screening clade types of field-collected An. funestus specimens accurately and efficiently in malaria vector research and control studies. \u00a9 2013 Choi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "Species occurring in unconnected, but similar habitats and under similar selection pressures often display strikingly comparable morphology, behaviour and life history. On island archipelagos where colonizations and extinctions are common, it is often difficult to separate whether similar traits are a result of in situ diversification or independent colonization without a phylogeny. Here, we use one of Hawaii's most ecologically diverse and explosive endemic species radiations, the Hawaiian fancy case caterpillar genus Hyposmocoma, to test whether in situ diversification resulted in convergence. Specifically, we examine whether similar species utilizing similar microhabitats independently developed largely congruent larval case phenotypes in lineages that are in comparable, but isolated environments. Larvae of these moths are found on all Hawaiian Islands and are characterized by an extraordinary array of ecomorphs and larval case morphology. We focus on the 'purse cases', a group that is largely specialized for living within rotting wood. Purse cases were considered a monophyletic group, because morphological, behavioural and ecological traits appeared to be shared among all members. We constructed a phylogeny based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences from 38 Hyposmocoma species, including all 14 purse case species and 24 of non-purse case congeners. Divergence time estimation suggests that purse case lineages evolved independently within dead wood and developed nearly identical case morphology twice: once on the distant Northwest Hawaiian Islands between 15.5 and 9\u00a0Ma and once on the younger main Hawaiian Islands around 3.0\u00a0Ma. Multiple ecomorphs are usually found on each island, and the ancestral ecomorph of Hyposmocoma appears to have lived on tree bark. Unlike most endemic Hawaiian radiations that follow a clear stepwise progression of colonization, purse case Hyposmocoma do not follow a pattern of colonization from older to younger island. We postulate that the diversity of microhabitats and selection from parasitism/predation from endemic predators may have shaped case architecture in this extraordinary endemic radiation of Hawaiian insects. \u00a9 2013 THE AUTHORS. \u00a9 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."

            "text": "Background: Host identification is an essential step in studies on the transmission dynamics of vector-borne disease. Nowadays, molecular tools allow the identification of vertebrate hosts to the species level. However, the proportion of successful identifications is variable and may be affected by the quality of the samples and the laboratory protocols. Here, the effect of two of these factors, namely the digestion status of mosquito blood meal and the DNA extraction procedure, on the success of host identification by amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase 1 gene were tested. Methods. Mosquitoes collected both outdoors and indoors during 2012 in southern Spain were identified to species level and their blood meal digestion status recorded using the Sella score, a visual estimation of the digestion status of mosquito blood meals. Each mosquito was assigned randomly to one of two DNA extraction procedures: the quick and cheap HotSHOT procedure or the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue\u00ae kit and their hosts identified by a molecular method. Results: Three hundred and forty-seven blood-fed mosquitoes belonging to Anopheles atroparvus (n=171), Culex perexiguus (n=84), Culex pipiens (n=43), Culex theileri (n=39), Culex modestus (n=5), Ochlerotatus caspius (n=4), Culiseta sp. (n=1) were included in this study. Overall, hosts were identified from 234 blood meals compromising at least 25 species including mammals, birds and a single reptile. The success of host identification was lower in mosquitoes with an advanced stage of blood meal digestion and for blood meals extracted using the HotSHOT procedure. Conclusions: The success of host identification decreases with the advanced stage of mosquito blood meal digestion, from 84.5% for recent blood meals to 25.0% for more digested ones. Using the QIAGEN kit, the identification success improved by 17.6%, with larger increases at more advanced stages of blood meal digestion. Availability of blood-fed females used to be very limited for studies of vector ecology, and these results may help to increase the efficiency of blood meal analyses. In addition, results obtained in this study clearly support that the potential malaria vector An. atroparvus feeds on animals located outdoors but use human-made shelters for resting after feeding. \u00a9 2013 Mart\u00ednez-de la Puente et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

            "text": "Trapping flies with sticky paper sheets is an ancient method. The classic flypaper has four typical characteristics: (i) its sticky paper is bright (chamois, light yellow or white), (ii) it is strip-shaped, (iii) it hangs vertically, and (iv) it is positioned high (several metres) above ground level. Such flypapers, however, do not trap horseflies (tabanids). There is a great need to kill horseflies with efficient traps because they are vectors of dangerous diseases, and due to their continuous annoyance livestock cannot graze, horses cannot be ridden, and meat and milk production from cattle is drastically reduced. Based on earlier findings on the positive polarotaxis (attraction to linearly polarised light) in tabanid flies and modifying the concept of the old flypaper, we constructed a new horsefly trap called \"horseflypaper\". In four field experiments we showed that the ideal horseflypaper (i) is shiny black, (ii) has an appropriately large (75\u00d775cm2) surface area, (iii) has sticky black vertical and horizontal surfaces in an L-shaped arrangement, and (iv) its horizontal surface should be at ground level for maximum effectiveness. Using imaging polarimetry, we measured the reflection-polarisation characteristics of this new polarisation tabanid trap. The ideal optical and geometrical characteristics of this trap revealed in field experiments are also explained. The horizontal part of the trap captures water-seeking male and female tabanids, while the vertical part catches host-seeking female tabanids. \u00a9 2013 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc."

The rove beetle Dalotia coriaria (Kraatz) is a predator of greenhouse pests including fungus gnats. In this study, stage-specific and total development, fecundity, longevity, and sex ratio were investigated under laboratory conditions using growing medium as a substrate, which was designed to simulate what rove beetles would experience under greenhouse conditions. Duration of life stages was 2.2, 7.1, and 7.8 days for egg, larva and pupa respectively, whereas total development time from egg to adult was 17.0 days. Average fecundity was 90.2 eggs per female and the number of adults produced per female was 69.1. In addition, D. coriaria male and female adult longevity was 60.3 and 47.8 days. The sex ratio was 1:1 (females:males). These results will be helpful in improving augmentative biological control and mass-rearing. \u00a9 2013 Kansas Entomological Society."

In this study, we investigated the morphology of the sperm storage organ, the spermatheca, in workers of the honeybees Apis cerana and Apis mellifera from Japan. All examined workers of the two species retain a small spermatheca. Ultrastructural observations indicate that the spermatheca of honeybee workers consists of conspicuous muscular layers which correspond with the sperm pump and that the epithelium surrounded by these muscular layers represents the spermatheca duct. As this epithelium shows intact cellular morphology, we conclude that the spermatheca duct and the sperm pump do not degenerate, whereas the spermatheca reservoir has completely degenerated. All workers of A. cerana and most workers of A. mellifera lack the spermatheca gland completely. A few workers of A. mellifera possess the opening of the spermatheca gland, but its structure seems to be degenerated. The spermathecal width including the muscular layers showed a weak, but significant positive correlation with ovariole numbers in A. cerana, but not in A. mellifera. The degree of spermatheca gland degeneration seems to be unrelated to ovariole number. The morphological features of degeneration in honeybee workers are different from those of the vestigial spermatheca in ant workers, indicating that morphological worker virginity has evolved in a different way. \u00a9 2012 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag, France."

(Fabales: Fabaceae)] in northwestern Argentina during the last 3 yr. This species was detected in 30 localities of Salta, Santiago del Estero and Tucum\u00e1n provinces comprising a total area of about 541,000 ha. This species was observed for the first time developing on dry bean [Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabales: Fabaceae)] crops and feeding on 3 unrelated weeds [Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronquist (Asterales: Asteraceae), Brassica campestris (L.) Metzg. (Brassicales: Brassicaceae) and Sphaeralcea bonariensis (Cav.) Griseb (Malvales: Malvaceae)]. The damage produced by R. subtilis in dry bean crops is similar to that produced in soybean crops. The results obtained suggest that as of 2012, R. subtilis has greatly expanded its distribution since its first detection in 2006 and produces major direct and indirect damage in soybean and dry bean crops in northwestern Argentina."

Dreaming about insects has a peculiar history, marked by our desire to explain a dream's significance and by the tactic of evoking emotions by injecting insects in dream-related works of art, film, music, and literature. I surveyed a scattered literature for examples of insects in dreams, first from the practices of dream interpretation, psychiatry, and scientific study, then from fictional writings and popular culture, and finally in the etymology of entomology by highlighting insects with dream-inspired Latinate names. A wealth of insects in dreams, as documented clinically and culturally, attests to the perceived relevance of dreams and to the ubiquity of insects in our lives. \u00a9 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Control of H. axyridis in vineyards is difficult as their populations may fluctuate daily, and there are few products registered to control this pest. Sulfur dioxide, in the form of potassium metabisulfite (KMS), is commonly used in wine as both an antimicrobial and an antioxidant. In this study, the effectiveness of KMS as a repellent against H. axyridis was measured. In a Y-tube olfactometer, H. axyridis spent significantly less time in the treatment arm (KMS 2.5, 5, and 10 g/liter) than in the control arm during a 10-min period. When sprayed in a vineyard, KMS significantly reduced the number of H. axyridis on grape vines. KMS is an effective repellent against H. axyridis and may be suitable for use in vineyards to control this pest. KMS (5 g/liter) applied to Riesling grapes at 2 wk, 1 wk, 3 d, or 1 d before harvest did not affect free sulfur dioxide in either freshly processed or settled juice. This study lays the foundation for the development of a pest management strategy incorporating repellents for H. axyridis in vineyards. \u00a9 2012 Entomological Society of America."

The rise of insecticide resistance and changing transmission dynamics urgently demand vector control innovation. To identify behavioral traits that could be incorporated into such tools, we investigated the flight and landing response of Anopheles coluzzii to human-like host cues. We show that landing rate is directly proportional to the surface area of thermal stimulus, whereas close-range orientation is modulated by both thermal and visual inputs. We modeled anopheline eye optics to theorize the distance at which visual targets can be detected under a range of conditions, and experimentally established mosquito preference for landing on larger targets, although landing density is greater on small targets. Target orientation does not affect landing rate; however, vertical targets can be resolved at greater distance than horizontal targets of the same size. Mosquito traps for vector control could be significantly enhanced by incorporating these features. \u00a9 2023 The Authors"

Sand fly entomological data in northern Kenya are scarce due to limited studies and neglect of leishmaniasis. The aim of this study was to investigate: (i) sand fly diversity and distribution; (ii) occurrence of Leishmania DNA within sand flies; and (iii) blood-meal sources of sand flies in Laisamis, northern Kenya. We conducted an entomological survey during February and March of 2021 in five areas of Laisamis sub-county using standard CDC light traps. A total of 1009 sand flies (394 male and 615 female) were morphologically identified, and representative samples verified by PCR amplification and sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. Similarly, we identified blood-meal sources and Leishmania DNA in female sand flies by PCR amplicon sequencing of the vertebrate cytochrome b (cyt b) gene and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of the 28S rRNA gene, respectively. Sergentomyia clydei (59.8%) was the most abundant sand fly species. Though collected mainly from one locality (Tirgamo), 14.8% of samples belonged to Phlebotomus (Artemievus) alexandri Sinton, 1928. We detected DNA of Leishmania major in 5.19% of Ph. alexandri, whereas Leishmania adleri DNA was detected in S. clydei (7.51%), Sergentomyia squamipleuris (8.00%), and Sergentomyia africanus (8.33%). Nine of 13 blood-fed sand flies had obtained blood from humans, of which 33.3% had L. major DNA. Both Ph. alexandri and S. clydei primarily fed on humans and could potentially be involved in the transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of sand fly vector populations and their potential to transmit leishmaniasis in the area. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)"

            "text": "Background and Objective: Rearing insects in the laboratory is fundamental to solving problems related to basic and applied entomology. Helicoverpa armigera (H\u00fcbner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is considered as one of the most economically important pests for worldwide agriculture. Maintaining colonies of this insect in the laboratory allows advances in integrated pest management studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate different diets for H. armigera growth and successfully establish the growth of this lepidoptera-pest in laboratory conditions. Materials and Methods: The larvae of H. armigera were rearing in three diets. The egg and larva stages were kept in a heated room with a temperature of 28\u00b12\u00b0C, UR of 60\u00b110% and 14 h of photophase. Twenty-five couples per diet were individualized in cylindrical cages made of PVC pipe kept at 25\u00b12\u00b0C, UR of 60\u00b110% and 14 h of photophase. The data from larval stage were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis and the means were compared by Dunn method. Biological parameters of adults were submitted to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s test. The viability of the different development stages were compared by Fisher\u2019s exact test. The sex rate was submitted to the x2. Results: The artificial diets presented a higher viability in the stages egg, larva, pre-pupa and pupa and lower development period in regard to the natural diet. The shortest larval period was recorded on the chickpea-based diet. The pre-pupal period was similar in the diets evaluated. The moths that developed on the natural diet showed a longevity that was significantly less than on the other two diets. The pre-oviposition, oviposition and incubation of eggs periods did not present a statistical difference. The population would increase daily by 6, 5 and 3% on the chickpea, bean and green bean diet. Conclusion: The present study indicated that the artificial diets were more adequate for H. armigera and the chickpea-based diet resulted in a shorter generation time of H. armigera. \u00a9 2017 Matheus Le Senechal Nunes et al."

Arthropods cultured in the laboratory for research, or mass-reared for novel control methods, must therefore be of a standard size range and known quality so that results are reproducible. Methods: A simple two-step technique to assess laboratory culture methods was demonstrated using the mosquito Anopheles gambiae s.s. as a model. First, the ranges of key development outcomes were determined using various diet levels. The observed outcomes described the physiologically constrained limits. Secondly, the same outcomes were measured when using a standard operating procedure (SOP) for comparison with the determined ranges. Results: The standard method resulted in similar development rates to those of high and medium diets, wing length between those resulting from the high and medium diets, and larval survival exceeding all benchmark diet level values. The SOP used to produce experimental material was shown to produces high-quality material, relative to the biologically constrained limits. Conclusions: The comparison between all possible phenotypic outcomes, as determined by biological constraints, with those outcomes obtained using a given rearing protocol is termed \"benchmarking\". A method is here demonstrated which could be easily adapted to other arthropods, to objectively assess important characters obtained, and methods used, during routine culture that may affect outcomes of research. \u00a9 2016 Valerio et al."

While these data show that the Dorset intensively used sites at different locations through the Arctic and Subarctic, very little information is known regarding their impact on their surroundings and the environment. Our research is based on soil samples collected at the site of Phillip\u2019s Garden, which is considered to be one of the most intensely occupied sites within the Dorset culture\u2019s geographic range. Beetles, which are known to be ecological specialists, were used as a proxy in this research in order to document the composition and fluctuation in vegetation, and environmental change through time at the site.

A key limitation for achieving control of A. aegypti has been the lack of effective tools for monitoring its population, and thus determine what control measures actually work. Surveillance of A. aegypti has been based mainly on immature indexes, but they bear little relation to the number of mosquito females, which are the ones capable of transmitting the viruses. The recent development of sampling techniques for adults of this vector species promises to facilitate surveillance and control activities. In this review, we present the various monitoring techniques for this mosquito, along with a discussion of their usefulness, and recommendations for improved entomological surveillance."

            "text": "Abstract Background: The biological concept of species stresses the importance of understanding what mechanisms maintain species reproductively isolated from each other. Often such mechanisms are divided into premating and postmating, with the latest being the result of either prezygotic or postzygotic isolation barriers. Drosophila willistoni quechua and Drosophila willistoni willistoni are two subspecies that experience reproductive isolation. When a D. w. quechua female is crossed with a D. w. willistoni male, the hybrid males (F1QW) are unable to father progeny; however, the reciprocal cross produces fertile hybrids. Thus, the mechanism of isolation is unidirectional hybrid male sterility. However, the sterile F1QW males contain large amounts of motile sperm. Here we explore whether pre-copulatory or post-copulatory pre-zygotic mechanisms serve as major deterrents in the ability of F1QW males to father progeny. Results: Comparisons of parental and hybrid males copulation durations showed no significant reduction in copulation duration of F1QW males. Interrupted copulations of the parental species confirmed that sperm transfer occurs before the minimum copulation duration registered for F1QW males. However, we found that when females mate with F1QW males, sperm is not present inside the female storage organs and that the lack of sperm in storage is due to failure to transfer sperm rather than spillage or active sperm dumping by females. Conclusions: Sterility of F1QW hybrid males is primarily driven by their inability to transfer sperm during copulation. \u00a9 2015 Civetta and Gaudreau."

The experiment was planned in randomized block design with gross plot size 4.2 x 4.4 m2 and net plot size 3.0 x 4.0 m2 with twelve treatments replicated thrice with the object to study the effect of some insecticides against pigeonpea pod fly,Melanagromyza obtuse. In evaluation study ten treatments were tested against pod fly,Melanagromyza obtuse. on pigeonpea .The result revealed that treatment Deltamethrin 1 EC + Triazophos 35 EC emerged as the most effective treatment against M. obtusa in minimizing the damage to green and dry pods as well as grains. Thiaclopride 21.7 SC and Profenophos 50 EC were found significantly effective in minimizing the cumulative mean per cent infestation of pod fly of pigeonpea. These findings indicate that the pigeonpea crop required two sprays of newer insecticides from pod initiation stage at 15 days interval for the management of pigeonpea pod fly, Melanagromyza obtusa."

            "text": "Necrophagous Sarcophagidae are among the insects most frequently reported from human corpses. The broad forensic application of flesh flies is restricted by the lack of reliable tools for species identification of larval stages and mass breeding of collected flesh fly larvae to the adult stage, and more recently DNA-based methods are usually recommended for precise species identification. To overcome this situation, the following study was implemented: (1) original larval material was obtained of the European flesh flies of confirmed or potential forensic importance; (2) larval morphology was studied and documented using a combination of standard light microscopy, image-stacking stereomicroscopy and SEM; and (3) larval characters used in previously published keys were critically revised. The taxonomic value of the following characters was considered insignificant: (1) differences in level of sclerotisation of particular parts of the cephaloskeleton, (2) level of sclerotisation of the posterior spiracular peritreme and (3) the shape of posterior spiracular slits. A high taxonomic value was noticed for the general shape of anterior spiracles, pattern of arrangement of their lobes, and distribution and shape of spines/warts on the inter-band area of segments. Two character states\u2014long window in the dorsal cornu of cephaloskeleton and deep spiracular cavity on anal division\u2014are not found in the Miltogramminae and therefore cannot be considered as family-specific for the entire Sarcophagidae. As a comprehensive result of our studies, an identification key is presented for the third instar larvae of European flesh flies of forensic importance. The key is user-friendly and requires no dissections of larvae, as soaking the material in methyl salicylate will allow observation of all diagnostic details of the cephaloskeleton. A simple stereomicroscope (magnification about \u00d750) is sufficient for the observation of all characters presented in the key. This key may be systematically extended by the addition of species present in adjacent geographical regions. \u00a9 2015, The Author(s)."

            "text": "High visual acuity allows parallel processing of distant environmental features, but only when photons are abundant enough. Diurnal tiger beetles (Carabidae: Cicindelinae) have acute vision for insects and visually pursue prey in open, flat habitats. Their fast running speed causes motion blur that degrades visual contrast, forces stop-and-go pursuit and potentially impairs obstacle detection. We demonstrate here that vision is insufficient for obstacle detection during running, and show instead that antennal touch is both necessary and sufficient for obstacle detection. While running, tiger beetle vision appears to be photon-limited in a way reminiscent of animals in lowlight habitats. Such animals often acquire wide-field spatial information through mechanosensation mediated by longer, more mobile appendages. We show that a nocturnal tiger beetle species waves its antennae in elliptical patterns typical of poorly sighted insects. While antennae of diurnal species are also used for mechanosensation, they are rigidly held forward with the tips close to the substrate. This enables timely detection of path obstructions followed by an increase in body pitch to avoid collision. Our results demonstrate adaptive mechanosensory augmentation of blurred visual information during fast locomotion, and suggest that future studies may reveal non-visual sensory compensation in other fast-moving animals. \u00a9 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of Trichospilus diatraeae Cherian & Margabandhu (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) to parasitize pupae of lepidopteran pests of oil palm. Groups of fifty females of T. diatraeae were maintained inside test tubes with one pupa of one of the following hosts: O. invirae, B. sophorae or E. cyparissias for 48 h. Trichospilus diatraeae parasitized the 3 Lepidopteran species, but reproduced only on O. invirae and B. sophorae. These results suggest that this parasitoid, of polyphagous habit, may represent an alternative for the control of lepidopteran pests of oil palm in the Brazilian Amazon."

Solms (Commelinales: Pontederiaceae), a destructive and widespread invasive plant. However, we do not know whether Neochetina weevils induce resistance in E. crassipes. I report results from excised-leaf bioassay and whole-plant choice experiments testing adult weevil preference and performance in response to previous damage. I found that adult weevil damage induced resistance in E. crassipes, decreasing weevil performance, but simulated damage did not influence weevil performance in a comparable way. Simulated damage did, however, influence weevil preference. This study is the first test for induced resistance to Neochetina weevil herbivory in Eichhornia crassipes."

Neither of the substances proved attractive or toxic. All had good application ability except sorbitol. Glycerol showed the best distribution compared to tylose and sugar water (chi-square test, f = 1, P \u2264 0.01). So the distribution of glycerol within a colony was shown by macro-computed tomography: it was quick and even (comparing density values before and after treatment, Mann-Whitney rank sum test, P \u2264 0.001). Glycerol can be recommended as a substitute for sugar water in medicinal treatments. Yet, its use with active ingredients should be investigated for combinatory effects. \u00a9 2012 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France."

Aim of this paper was to investigate the processes that lead to a complete species inventory at a regional level for a beetle family. The tenebionid beetles of Latium region (Italy) were analysed as a case study representative of general situations. A comprehensive faunistic database including 3,561 records spanning from 1871 to 2010 was realized examining 25,349 museum specimens and published data. Accumulation curves and non-parametric estimators of species richness were applied to model increase in faunistic knowledge over time, through space and by collectors' number. Long time, large spatial extent and contribution of many collectors were needed to obtain a reliable species inventory. Massive sampling was not effective in recovering more species. Amateur naturalists (here called parafaunists) were more efficient collectors than professional entomologists. Museum materials collected by parafaunists over long periods and large spatial extent resulted to be a cost effective source of faunistic information with small number of collected individuals. It is therefore important to valuate and facilitate the work of parafaunists as already suggested for parataxonomists. By contrast, massive collections by standardized techniques for ecological research seem to be of scarce utility in improving faunistic knowledge, but their value for faunistic studies may be enhanced if they are conducted in poorly surveyed areas. \u00a9 2013 Simone Fattorini."

In addition, the National Malaria Control Programmes of these countries have virtually identical policies: (1) Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of symptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection, (2) Long-Lasting Insecticide-treated bed Nets (LLINs) to reduce the Entomololgic Inoculation Rate (EIR), and (3) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for the Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp). However, the prevalence of P. falciparum malaria and the status of malaria control vary markedly across the four sites with differences in the duration of the transmission season (from 4-5 to 10-11 months), the intensity of transmission (with EIRs from unmeasurably low to 4-5 per person per month), multiplicity of infection (from a mean of 1.0 to means of 2-5) and the status of malaria control (from areas which have virtually no control to areas that are at the threshold of malaria elimination). The most important priority is the need to obtain comparable data on the population-based prevalence, incidence and transmission of malaria before new candidate interventions or combinations of interventions are introduced for malaria control. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V."

We used light microscopy, staining (Gomori's trichrome and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)), and a routine histological analysis method (hematoxilin-eosin). The insects were obtained from, and also bred in, the Laboratory of Entomology, Department of Biology, of the Rural Federal University of Pernambuco (UFRPE). The collected material was fixed in alcoholic Bo\u00fcin and embedded in paraplast. The results demonstrated that the midgut wall is composed of an inner epithelial layer and two outer layers of striate muscles: one internal (circular) and the other external (longitudinal), with connective tissue between the muscle fibers. The epithelium is single-layered, with two cell types: regenerative and elongated columnar. The gastric caeca presents muscle layers similar to those of the midgut. Simple columnar epithelium lines the gastric caeca, which presents villi and projects towards the lumen. The pyloric valve is of striate muscle tissue, covered by a single epithelial-cell layer."

Our aim was evaluate the presence of phlebotomine sandflies in an important rural area with eco-epidemiological interest in San Bernardo del Viento (C\u00f3rdoba, Colombia). Materials and Methods. The insects identified were collected using CDC-traps and manual aspirator in closed trees between May to August 2015. The specimens were conserved and fragmented for clarification of internal structures and identification of morphological keys. Results. Three species of phlebotomine sand flies were identified: Lutzomyia gomezi (Nitzulescu 1931), Pintomyia rangeliana (Ortiz 1952) y Micropygomyia cayennensis (Floch & Abonnenc 1941). Conclusions. The presence of L. gomezi, main vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia, is a risk factor for rural people from the zone. \u00a9 2017. All rights reserved"

However, conducting research on repellent is challenging for several reasons: (1) the different repellent phenomena are not well defined; (2) it is difficult to test for and quantify repellent; (3) the physiological mechanisms are poorly known; (4) the field efficacy appears to be highly variable. Here, we identified five different types of repellent: expellency, irritancy, deterrency, odor masking and visual masking, and described behavioral bioassays to differentiate between them. Although these categories are currently defined by their behavioral response to different stimuli, we suggest new definitions based on their mechanism of action. We put forward three main hypotheses on the physiological mechanism: (1) a dose effect that modifies the behavior, (2) a repellent mechanism with specific receptors, or (3) inhibition of the transduction of neural information. \u00a9 2016, Springer International Publishing."

The results indicate that, the poison was better detected in puparia cases compared to adults. This is valuable as puparia abundance at carrion in the late stages of decomposition is a common phenomenon compared to maggots and adults. Hence, standard operating procedures for collecting entomological evidence at death scene involving heavily decomposed remains should focus on collecting puparia, as they could be a link to cause of death, especially when foul play by poisoning is suspected."

In the current study, a new aleocharine species, Aleochara pseudochrysorrhoa sp. nov., from southern Brazil, is described and its natural history is briefly discussed. The species has a robust body, uniformly dark-brown to black with apex of abdomen rust-brown, median lobe of male with expanded bulbus, sderites of internal sac forming complex arrangement, and female with spermatheca L-shaped. Aleochara pseudochrysorrhoa sp. nov. may be considered to be closely related to the species belonging to the lustrica group. A complete checklist of Neotropical species of Aleochara is also provided. Nomenclatural problems are also discussed. Aleochara lateralis Erichson, 1839 is a junior primary homonym of A lateralis Heer, 1839, and is replaced by the available name Aleochara bonariensis Lynch, 1884. A new name, Aleochara newtoni nom. nov., is proposed to replace Maseochara (= Aleochara) duplicata Sharp, 1883, which is a junior secondary homonym of A duplicata Erichson, 1839."

We combined entomological surveys, movement simulations of air-borne particles, and population genetics to reconstruct the chain of events that led to a newly colonized French area nestled at the northern foot of the Pyrenees. Simulating the movement of air-borne particles evidenced frequent wind-transport events allowing, within at most 36 hours, the immigration of midges from north-eastern Spain and Balearic Islands, and, as rare events, their immigration from Corsica. Completing the puzzle, population genetic analyses discriminated Corsica as the origin of the new population and identified two successive colonization events within west-Mediterranean basin. Our findings are of considerable importance when trying to understand the invasion of new territories by expanding species."

Overall, 2508 butterflies belonging to 19 species were recorded. Of these, the four most numerous species accounted for almost 88% of all individuals recorded. These were the migratory Clouded Yellow Colias croceus, Red Admiral Vanessa atalanta and Painted Lady Vanessa cardui, and the sedentary Common Blue Polyommatus icarus. There was a significant correlation between abundance of P. icarus and C. croceus. Furthermore, abundances of C. croceus and V. atalanta were correlated. The sometimes very high abundance of migratory butterflies at the study site could suggest that Gibraltar is a stopover site for butterflies migrating between Africa and Europe."

            "text": "Eggs of Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller) are widely used in mass rearing of parasitoids, especially Trichogramma spp. and predators in many biological-control programs. The objective of this study was to improve the efficiency of mass rearing of A. kuehniella through determining the optimal temperature conditions for rearing, by assessing the effect of temperature during the developmental stages on the reproduction of A. kuehniella. We evaluated 1) the effect of temperature at which A. kuehniella was kept from egg to adult death, on reproduction; 2) the effect of temperature during the larval and pupal stages on oviposition; and 3) the effect of different temperatures on adults that originated from larvae kept in a constant temperature of 25\u00b0C. The results indicated that the optimal temperature range for the development of A. kuehniella is between 20-30\u00b0C, as at 30\u00b0C there was a marked decrease in viability of the egg and larval stages. The best temperature for maintaining A. kuehniella from egg to adult death is 25\u00b0C. Temperatures of 30 and 32\u00b0C lead to deformations in genitalia of males, reducing the viability of eggs, and also eggs and females from these temperatures have lower weights. The rearing temperature of immatures affects the egg-laying capacity of adults and the egg viability. The oviposition capacity of adults kept in different temperatures ranging from 18 to 32\u00b0C, after being reared in constant temperature (25\u00b0C) during the larval stages, was not affected. \u00a9 2013 Entomological Society of America."
